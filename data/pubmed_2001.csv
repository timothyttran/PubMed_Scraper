1,33922573,10.3390/ijerph18094486,Climate Change and Mental Health: A Scoping Review.,"Climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations. This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (<i>n</i> = 67), cross-sectional (<i>n</i> = 42), conducted in high-income countries (<i>n</i> = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities-assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (<i>n</i> = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (<i>n</i> = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (<i>n</i> = 8); mitigation and adaptation (<i>n</i> = 7); improving decision-support (<i>n</i> = 3); and cost estimations (<i>n</i> = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.",04/23/2021,"{'Barbic, Skye P': ['Social Aetiology of Mental Illness Training Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']}",International journal of environmental research and public health,eng,"['climate', 'environmental health', 'global health', 'mental disorders']",['mental health']

3,37666576,10.1136/bmjgh-2023-013232,Reimagining global mental health in Africa.,"In 2001, the WHO launched The World Health Report most specifically addressing low-income and middle-income countries (LAMICs). It highlighted the importance of mental health (MH), identifying the severe public health impacts of mental ill health and made 10 recommendations. In 2022, the WHO launched another world MH report and reaffirmed the 10 recommendations, while concluding that 'business as usual for MH will simply not do' without higher infusions of money. This paper suggests the reason for so little change over the last 20 years is due to the importation and imposition of Western MH models and frameworks of training, service development and research on the assumption they are relevant and acceptable to Africans in LAMICs. This ignores the fact that most mental and physical primary care occurs within local non-Western traditions of healthcare that are dismissed and assumed irrelevant by Western frameworks. These trusted local institutions of healthcare that operate in homes and spiritual spaces are in tune with the lives and culture of local people. We propose that Western foundations of MH knowledge are not universal nor are their assumptions of society globally applicable. Real change in the MH of LAMICs requires reimagining. Local idioms of distress and healing, and explanatory models of suffering within particular populations, are needed to guide the development of training curricula, research and services. An integration of Western frameworks into these more successful approaches are more likely to contribute to the betterment of MH for peoples in LAMICs.",09/NA/2023,"{'Durisko, Zachary': ['Social Aetiology of Mental Illness Training Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']}",BMJ global health,eng,"['Health policy', 'Health services research', 'Health systems', 'Mental Health & Psychiatry']",['mental health']

The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by which clinicians could fulfill the clinical guideline's recommendations. Since the release of the 2011 guideline, the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> has been revised to the fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates have been made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations. Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, numerous systemic barriers were identified that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians' ability to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created a companion article (available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD, which identifies the major systemic-level barriers and presents recommendations to address those barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.",10/NA/2019,"{'Ware, Emma': ['Social Aetiology of Mental Illness Training Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']}",Pediatrics,eng,No keywords,['ADHD']

Diagnosis of the disorder requires careful consideration of other psychiatric and medical disorders that may mimic symptoms of ADHD. Comorbid disorders are common in patients with ADHD and require careful attention. A recommended diagnostic evaluation for children and adults includes the completion of a psychiatric interview, rating scales from multiple informants, and often individually tailored psychologic testing. Pharmacologic treatment options include the first-line stimulant agents for adults and children and TCAs and atypical antidepressants as second-line agents. Behavioral interventions may help reduce ADHD symptoms and address comorbid conditions in children.

8,11548968,10.1037/0033-2909.127.5.571,Is ADHD a disinhibitory disorder?,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is widely theorized to stem from dysfunctional inhibitory processes. However, the definition of inhibition is imprecisely distinguished across theories. To clarify the evidence for this conception, the author relies on a heuristic distinction between inhibition that is under executive control and inhibition that is under motivational control (anxiety or fear). It is argued that ADHD is unlikely to be due to a motivational inhibitory control deficit, although suggestions are made for additional studies that could overturn that conclusion. Evidence for a deficit in an executive motor inhibition process for the ADHD combined type is more compelling but is not equally strong for all forms of executive inhibitory control. Remaining issues include specificity to ADHD, whether inhibitory problems are primary or secondary in causing ADHD, role of comorbid anxiety and conduct disorder, and functional deficits in the inattentive ADHD subtype.",09/NA/2001,"{'Ali, Suhailah': ['Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Queensland Health, Wacol, QLD 4076, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Herston, QLD 4006, Australia.']}",Psychological bulletin,eng,No keywords,['ADHD']
9,11563573,No DOI,Evaluation and treatment of ADHD.,"Symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are present in as many as 9 percent of school-age children. ADHD-specific questionnaires can help determine whether children meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The recommended evaluation also includes documenting the type and severity of ADHD symptoms, verifying the presence of normal vision and hearing, screening for comorbid psychologic conditions, reviewing the child's developmental history and school performance, and applying objective measures of cognitive function. The stimulants methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine remain the pharmacologic agents of first choice for the management of ADHD. These agents are equally effective in improving the core symptoms of the disorder, but individual children may respond better to one stimulant medication than to another. Achievement of maximal benefit may require titration of the initial dosage and dosing before breakfast, before lunch and in the afternoon. The family physician should tailor the treatment plan to meet the unique needs of the child and family.
