0,14709704,10.1093/jurban/jtg063,The built environment and mental health.,"The built environment has direct and indirect effects on mental health. High-rise housing is inimical to the psychological well-being of women with young children. Poor-quality housing appears to increase psychological distress, but methodological issues make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Mental health of psychiatric patients has been linked to design elements that affect their ability to regulate social interaction (e.g., furniture configuration, privacy). Alzheimer's patients adjust better to small-scale, homier facilities that also have lower levels of stimulation. They are also better adjusted in buildings that accommodate physical wandering. Residential crowding (number of people per room) and loud exterior noise sources (e.g., airports) elevate psychological distress but do not produce serious mental illness. Malodorous air pollutants heighten negative affect, and some toxins (e.g., lead, solvents) cause behavioral disturbances (e.g., self-regulatory ability, aggression). Insufficient daylight is reliably associated with increased depressive symptoms. Indirectly, the physical environment may influence mental health by altering psychosocial processes with known mental health sequelae. Personal control, socially supportive relationships, and restoration from stress and fatigue are all affected by properties of the built environment. More prospective, longitudinal studies and, where feasible, randomized experiments are needed to examine the potential role of the physical environment in mental health. Even more challenging is the task of developing underlying models of how the built environment can affect mental health. It is also likely that some individuals may be more vulnerable to mental health impacts of the built environment. Because exposure to poor environmental conditions is not randomly distributed and tends to concentrate among the poor and ethnic minorities, we also need to focus more attention on the health implications of multiple environmental risk exposure.",12/NA/2003,"{'Evans, Gary W': ['Department of Design and Environmental Analysis and Human Development, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. gwe1@cornell.edu']}",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,eng,No keywords,['mental health']

7,34501798,10.3390/ijerph18179208,Incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Diagnoses in Navarre (Spain) from 2003 to 2019.,"(1) Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) constitutes one of the leading mental health and behavioral disorders in childhood and adolescence. The main objective of this study was to analyze the time trend in the incidence of ADHD diagnoses in Navarre (Spain) from 2003 to 2019 in children and adolescents from 5 to 19 years old. Additionally, the seasonal trends of ADHD incidence and ADHD prevalence were determined. (2) Methods: A population-based observational retrospective study, which included people born between 1991 and 2011 and who attended compulsory education between 2007 and 2017 in Navarre (Spain), was carried out with data from both the Education and Health Department databases. (3) Results: The incidence rate increased from 4.18 cases per 1000 person-years in 2003 to 7.43 cases per 1000 person-years in 2009, before decreasing progressively to 2.1 cases per 1000 person-years in 2019. A peak incidence rate at 7-8 years of age was observed, which is consistent across the study period and for both genders. Males were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females, with similar time trends in both. A seasonal pattern in ADHD diagnosis was found, with peaks in February-March and the lowest rates in the summer months. Inattentive cases were much more frequent than hyperactive cases, whereas combined cases remained low across the study period. (4) Conclusions: In this age-period-cohort analysis, a clear period and age effect was observed. We found a decreasing trend in the ADHD incidence rate since 2015. Further research is needed to confirm whether a change of trend is occurring globally.",08/31/2021,"{'Vaillant, George E': [""Department of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. gvaillant@partners.org""]}",International journal of environmental research and public health,eng,"['attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'behavior disorder', 'hyperactivity', 'inattention']",['ADHD']

10,14609780,10.1001/archinte.163.20.2433,Depression and pain comorbidity: a literature review.,"Because depression and painful symptoms commonly occur together, we conducted a literature review to determine the prevalence of both conditions and the effects of comorbidity on diagnosis, clinical outcomes, and treatment. The prevalences of pain in depressed cohorts and depression in pain cohorts are higher than when these conditions are individually examined. The presence of pain negatively affects the recognition and treatment of depression. When pain is moderate to severe, impairs function, and/or is refractory to treatment, it is associated with more depressive symptoms and worse depression outcomes (eg, lower quality of life, decreased work function, and increased health care utilization). Similarly, depression in patients with pain is associated with more pain complaints and greater impairment. Depression and pain share biological pathways and neurotransmitters, which has implications for the treatment of both concurrently. A model that incorporates assessment and treatment of depression and pain simultaneously is necessary for improved outcomes.",11/10/2003,"{'Sharma, Alok': ['MCPHS University, Worcester/Manchester, NH, USA.']}",Archives of internal medicine,eng,No keywords,['depression']

In recent years, the literature on late-life depression has exploded. Many gaps in our understanding of the outcome of late-life depression have been filled. Intriguing findings have emerged regarding the etiology of late-onset depression. The number of studies documenting the evidence base for therapy has increased dramatically. Here, I first address case definition, and then I review the current community- and clinic-based epidemiological studies. Next I address the outcome of late-life depression, including morbidity and mortality studies. Then I present the extant evidence regarding the etiology of depression in late life from a biopsychosocial perspective. Finally, I present evidence for the current therapies prescribed for depressed elders, ranging from medications to group therapy.",03/NA/2003,"{'Couture, Justin': []}","The journals of gerontology.

12,12685676,10.1177/0884217503252133,Depression in adolescence.,"Major depressive disorder is a common problem for adolescents. It has a wide array of symptoms affecting somatic, cognitive, affective, and social processes. Academic failure, poor peer relationships, behavioral problems, conflict with parents and other authority figures, and substance abuse are some of the consequences of major depressive disorder in this age group. Effective treatments include nontricyclic antidepressants and coping skills training. The nurse is key to depression detection and suicide prevention, especially in primary care settings. Through psychoeducation, nurses can promote recovery from depression by encouraging a healthy lifestyle, enhancing social skills, and assisting the adolescent to identify and use sources of social support. These measures can prevent premature death and promote long-term well-being of the adolescent.",NA/NA/2003,"{'Klingberg, Torkel': [""Unit of Neuropediatrics, Department Women and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, 17176 Stockholm, Sweden. torkel.klingberg@kbh.ki.se""]}","Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",eng,No keywords,['depression']

A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (5-HT T) gene was found to moderate the influence of stressful life events on depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HT T promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides evidence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual's response to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.",07/18/2003,"{'Fernell, Elisabeth': []}","Science (New York, N.Y.)",eng,No keywords,['depression']
