ABSTRACT
Objective: Lack of consensus on the definition of
mental health has implications for research, policy and
practice. This study aims to start an international,
interdisciplinary and inclusive dialogue to answer the
question: What are the core concepts of mental health?
Design and participants: 50 people with expertise
in the field of mental health from 8 countries
completed an online survey. They identified the extent
to which 4 current definitions were adequate and what
the core concepts of mental health were. A qualitative
thematic analysis was conducted of their responses.
The results were validated at a consensus meeting of
58 clinicians, researchers and people with lived
experience.
Results: 46% of respondents rated the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC, 2006) definition as the most
preferred, 30% stated that none of the 4 definitions
were satisfactory and only 20% said the WHO (2001)
definition was their preferred choice. The least
preferred definition of mental health was the general
definition of health adapted from Huber et al (2011).
The core concepts of mental health were highly varied
and reflected different processes people used to
answer the question. These processes included the
overarching perspective or point of reference of
respondents (positionality), the frameworks used to
describe the core concepts (paradigms, theories and
models), and the way social and environmental factors
were considered to act. The core concepts of mental
health identified were mainly individual and functional,
in that they related to the ability or capacity of a person
to effectively deal with or change his/her environment.
A preliminary model for the processes used to
conceptualise mental health is presented.
Conclusions: Answers to the question, ‘What are the
core concepts of mental health?’ are highly dependent
on the empirical frame used. Understanding these
empirical frames is key to developing a useful
consensus definition for diverse populations.
INTRODUCTION
A
major
obstacle
for
integrating
mental
health
initiatives
into
global
health
pro-
grammes and primary healthcare services is
lack of consensus on a deﬁnition of mental
health.1–3 There is little agreement on a
general deﬁnition of ‘mental health’4 and
currently there is widespread use of the term
‘mental health’ as a euphemism for ‘mental
illness’.5 Mental health can be deﬁned as the
absence of mental disease or it can be
deﬁned as a state of being that also includes
the biological, psychological or social factors
which contribute to an individual’s mental
state and ability to function within the envir-
onment.4
6–11
For example,
the
WHO12
includes realising one’s potential, the ability
to cope with normal life stresses and commu-
nity contributions as core components of
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪Our study identifies a major obstacle for integrat-
ing mental health initiatives into global health
programmes and health service delivery, which
is a lack of consensus on a definition, and initi-
ates a global, interdisciplinary and inclusive dia-
logue towards a consensus definition of mental
health.
▪Despite the limitations of a small sample size and
response saturation, our sample of global experts
was able to demonstrate dissatisfaction with
current definitions of mental health and significant
agreement among subcomponents, specifically
factors beyond the ‘ability to adapt and self-
manage’, such as ‘diversity and community iden-
tity’ and creating distinct definitions, ‘one for indi-
vidual and a parallel for community and society’.
▪This research demonstrates how experts in the
field of mental health determine the core con-
cepts of mental health, presenting a model of
how empirical discourses shape definitions of
mental health.
▪We propose a transdomain model of health to
inform the development of a comprehensive def-
inition capturing all of the subcomponents of
health: physical, mental and social health.
▪Our study discusses the implications of the find-
ings for research, policy and practice in meeting
the needs of diverse populations.

and

Prevention strategies may aim to decrease the rates of
mental illness but promotion strategies aim at improving
mental health. The possible scope of promotion initia-
tives depends on the deﬁnition of mental health.
The purpose of this paper is to begin a global, interdis-
ciplinary, interactive and inclusive series of dialogues
leading to a consensus deﬁnition of mental health. It has
been stimulated and informed by a recent debate about
the need to redeﬁne the term health. Huber et al15
emphasised that health should encompass an individual’s
“ability to adapt and to self-manage” in response to chal-
lenges, rather than achieving “a state of complete well-
being” as stated in current WHO6 12 deﬁnitions. They
also argued that a new deﬁnition must consider the
demographics
of
stakeholders
involved
and
future
advances in science.15 Responses to the article suggested
the process of reconceptualising health be extended
“beyond the esoteric world of academia and the prag-
matic world of policy”16 to include a “much wider lens to
the aetiology of health”17 along with patients and lay
members of the public. Huber et al’s15 deﬁnition of
health could include mental health but it is not clear that
this would be satisfactory to patients, practitioners or
researchers. We aimed to compare the satisfaction of
mental health specialists, patients and the public with
Huber et al’s deﬁnition and other currently used deﬁni-
tions of mental health. We also asked them what they con-
sidered to be the core components of mental health.
METHODS
Participants and procedures
A pool of 25 researchers in mental health was identi-
ﬁed through literature/internet searches to capture
expertise
in
(1)
‘community
mental
health’
and
‘public mental health’, (2) ‘human rights’ and ‘global
mental health’, (3) ‘positive mental health’ and ‘resili-
ence’, (4) ‘recovery’ and ‘mental health’, and (5)
‘natural
selection’
and
‘evolutionary
origins’
of
‘mental health’. Each of these ﬁve areas was assigned
to an author with expertise in that area who then con-
ducted a series of literature/internet searches using
the key terms listed above. Proposed participants were
identiﬁed based on their expert contributions, such as
published papers, presentations, community outreach,
and other evidence of work in their ﬁeld that had
implications for mental health. Each author presented
their list to the research team which then narrowed
the number to 5 per category for a total of 25 initial
participants. An additional 31 individuals were added,
which
included
people
with
lived
experience
of
mental illness as well as the mentors of the Social
Aetiology
of
Mental
Illness
(SAMI)
Training
Programme (funded by the Canadian Institutes of
Health
Research
and
includes
a
multidisciplinary
group of experts with diverse interests, including bio-
logical, social and psychological sciences); all of these
participants were identiﬁed through the SAMI/Centre
for Addiction and Mental Health network. Fifty-six
participants were sent the survey in the ﬁrst round.
Two subsequent rounds were completed using a snow-
balling technique: each person in round 1 was asked
to indicate up to three other people they thought
should receive the survey, which was then distributed
to those identiﬁed individuals. This was repeated in
round 2.
The ‘What is Mental Health?’ survey was created and
distributed electronically using the SurveyMonkey plat-
form. Respondents were asked to describe their areas of
expertise, and list or describe the core concepts of
mental health. Respondents ranked four deﬁnitions
(without citations) of mental health12 15 18 (McKenzie K.
Community deﬁnition of Mental Health. What Is Mental
Health Survey. Centre for Addiction and Mental Health,
personal communication, 15 January 2014) and a ﬁfth
choice of ‘None of the existing deﬁnitions are satisfac-
tory’ in order of preference (1=most preferred, 5=least
preferred), and could rate multiple deﬁnitions as most
and/or least preferred (see table 1). Respondents were
asked to state, ‘What was missing and why?’ from these
deﬁnitions.
Data analysis
Thematic analysis19 was used to evaluate the core con-
cepts of mental health, followed by triangulation (ie,
multiple methods, analysts or theory/perspectives) to
verify and validate the qualitative data analysis.20
First, multiple analysts with knowledge from different
disciplines reviewed the data.20 Our collective areas of
expertise encompass the following: animal models of
human behaviour; arts; clinical, cognitive, political and
social psychology; ecology; education; epidemiology; evo-
lutionary
theory;
humanities;
knowledge
translation;
measurement; molecular biology; neuroscience; occupa-
tional therapy; psychiatry; qualitative and quantitative
research; social aetiology of mental illness; toxicology
and transcultural health. All transcripts were reviewed by
each coder ﬁrst independently, then collectively, to
become familiar with the data and create a mutually
agreed on code book using NVivo 10. Codes were orga-
nised into themes, and compared and contrasted manu-
ally and through NVivo10 coding queries within each
major theme and across response items. Initial models
derived from the data were created and validated by the
multidisciplinary research team.
Second, method triangulation was used to assess the
consistency of our ﬁndings.20 Preliminary results from
the survey were presented and discussed at the 4th
Annual Social Aetiology of Mental Illness Conference
(20 May 2014) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental
Health,
University
of
Toronto
(Toronto,
Ontario,
Canada). Attendees were divided into ﬁve focus groups

of 10–12 people facilitated by a project leader and
2 trained note takers. The two consecutive 1 h focused
discussions
used
the
ORID
method
(Objective,
Reﬂective, Interpretive and Decisional)21 in order to
elicit feedback on the methods and results of the survey.
All responses from each of the ﬁve groups were tran-
scribed by two recorders and disseminated to the
research team for individual and collaborative review.
A second round of data analysis was conducted to val-
idate the results according to key areas of interest and
critique reported by the conference participants.
RESULTS
Survey respondents
Fifty-six surveys were distributed in the ﬁrst round, 28 in
the second and 38 in the third. Fifty people completed
the survey (rounds 1, 2 and 3 had 32, 12 and 6 respon-
dents, respectively) with a total response rate of 41%.
Two-thirds
of
respondents
(66%)
were
male
and
one-third were female (34%). Respondents’ current
country of residence/employment included Canada
(52%), UK (20%), USA (14%), Australia (6%), New
Zealand (2%), Brazil (2%), South Africa (2%) and
Togo (2%). The majority of respondents (72%) held
academic positions at postsecondary institutions and
were conducting research in the broad ﬁeld of mental
health. Sixty per cent were also involved in giving advice
to mental health services or managing them. Thirty-four
per cent of respondents were clinicians.
Survey items
Respondents
had
diverse
expertise
(see
table
2).
Forty-six per cent of respondents rated the Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)18 deﬁnition as their
most preferred. However, 30% stated that none were sat-
isfactory. The WHO deﬁnition12 was preferred by 20%.
The least preferred deﬁnition of mental health was the
general deﬁnition of health adapted from Huber et al15
(see table 1).
Analysis of the three open-ended items established four
major themes—Positionality, Social/Environmental Factors,
Paradigms/Theories/Models and the Core Concepts of Mental
Health—and ﬁve-directional relationships between them
(ﬁgure 1). Positionality represented the overarching per-
spective
or
point-of-reference
from
which
the
Core
Concepts were derived; whereas Paradigms/Theories/Models
represented the theoretical framework within which the
Core Concepts were described. Core Concepts represented
factors related to the individual; these were distinguish-
able from the Social/Environmental Factors related to
society.
Five
signiﬁcant
relationships
between
these
themes were established (ﬁgure 1). First, respondents’
theoretical framework (Direction A) inﬂuenced the over-
arching point-of-reference they used to describe the core
concepts and vice versa (Direction B). Positionality and
Paradigms/Theories/Models
signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced
the
core concepts respondents provided and the correspond-
ing descriptions (Direction C). Respondents described
how social and environmental factors impacted the core
concepts (Direction D) and reciprocally, how the core
concepts could inﬂuence society (Direction E) (tables 3
and 4). Feedback from the conference focus groups
showed support for these ﬁve-directional relationships
but questioned whether there was evidence for other
direct relationships, speciﬁcally the impact of Social/
Environmental Factors on both Paradigms/Theories/Models
and Positionality. A second round of data analysis con-
ﬁrmed these relationships were not explicitly reported by
respondents in the survey. Respondents did not discuss

threats and offer support and aid for those in need”

The theme of Positionality demonstrated how respon-
dents positioned their conceptualisations of mental
health within an explicit or implicit framework of
understanding (table 3, ﬁgures 2 and 3). Several
respondents described the core concepts in terms of
binary or conﬂicting dynamics or as categorical or continu-
ous. Some respondents pointed to the mutual exclusiv-
ity of ‘mental health’ and ‘mental illness’ while others
described these concepts as distinct points separated
on
a
continuum
or
as
overlapping.

speciﬁed the complexity of mental health, for example,
positioning mental health explicitly outside of, and spe-
ciﬁcally in between, the individual and society. Several
respondents
framed
the
core
concepts
of
mental
health as descriptive versus prescriptive, arguing that these
must
be
empirically
determined
and
deﬁned
(ie,
describing what is) rather than prescribed according to
values and morals (ie, describing what should be). In
accordance with Hume’s Law (ie, an ‘ought’ cannot be
derived from an ‘is’),22 several respondents cautioned
that problems of living, such as ‘poverty, vices, social
injustices and stupidity’, should not be deﬁned ‘as
medical
problems’.
Many
respondents
described
mental health in relation to hierarchical levels, and/or
temporal trajectories, and/or context (table 3, ﬁgure 3).
Respondents articulated the multiple levels at which
mental health can be understood (ie, from the basic
unit of the gene, through the individual and up to the
globe)
and
how
meaning
changes
across
time
(ie, mental health described as functioning in line with
our evolutionary ancestors, to current developmental
mechanisms and including expectations of a peaceful
death
and
spiritual
existence)

across

Participant responses
Binary/conflicting
dynamic
“There are two options represented in the philosophy of mental health. EITHER the absence of
mental illness/disease/disorder where that is defined in some either value-laden or value-free way. It
may be a simple definition (such as endogenous failure of ordinary doing or harmful dysfunction) or a
cluster concept. Health is then its absence. Typically such definitions unify mental and physical
health. OR the positive presence of something like flourishing. This underpins approaches to
recovery in mental healthcare. It risks equating health and wellbeing” (ie, Directions A and B)
“The core concepts of mental health can be organized as a binary and conflicting dynamic that is
seeking integration and resolution. On the one hand we have inequity, adversity, trauma, alienation,
exclusion, discrimination, stigma, loneliness, stress and mental overwhelm. On the other we have
empathy, compassion, dignity, honesty, innovation, peer support, economic equity, social justice,
community involvement, mindfulness and recovery” (ie, Directions B–C)
Complexity
“The term means little to me. It is too general and is used, either in the negative or the positive, to
indicate such a range of states of being that the term is almost without meaning”
“Not located only in the person, but in the interaction between the person and her/his environment”
“Mental health does not exist within the individual, within the brain, within the neurons or within brain
chemicals, or within genes. Mental health is both affected by them all but also has effect upon them
all. That relation extends also to everything outside the individual: eg, my relations with myself, other
individuals, the human world, my immediate environment, my neighbourhood, culture, society,
socio-political-economic systems, my environment and the planet we live on” (ie, Direction A;
Directions B–C–E)
Dichotomy vs
continuum
“The mental wellbeing of the individual as well the ‘health’ of the community in which they exist—
social determinants that lead to good or poor mental health—mental health = continuum between
mental wellbeing and mental illness—prevention as well as treatment” (ie, Directions B–C–E)
“Health and illness belong to distinct continuous dimensions”
Descriptive vs
prescriptive
(Hume’s law*)
“The key is to shoot for a definition which is in the middle: not to high, so that perfect is required, nor
too low…it must have something to do with reasonably good functioning, where reasonably is
conceived in terms of the legal standard as average quality. Clearly, you’re not mentally well, if you
have below-average mental functioning, such that your ability to perform average tasks is impaired”
“Moreover, what includes too much. The references to spiritual well-being have got to go, as if
non-believers have defective mental health by definition—The third [definition] is good, except for the
excessively demanding realization of potential. There’s a difference between perfect mental health,
and just simply mental health, and too many definitions conflate the two…the offered definition is too
much and too contested qua definition (as opposed to theory)”
“I think all of these definitions are too broad. The first, third, and fourth [definitions] look closer to
definitions of the good life, or good community, than of health. Lots of things can cause people
problems—poverty, vices, social injustice, stupidity—a definition of health should not end up defining
these as medical problems”
“There is no definition of positive mental health nor will there be in my view because too many issues
are at stake and the most important is the absence of a serious mental illness or other emotional,
psycho-physical, and moral problems”
“Most of these [definitions] have too much stuff, creating unattainable goals and sounding like they
were crafted by a committee wanting to cover all the bases and to be politically correct”
*Hume’s law, that is, an “ought” cannot be derived from an “is” (Segal and Tauber).22

models and bias against other sources of information;
there was support for objective and subjective sources in
conceptualising mental health.
A second theme of Paradigms/Theories/Models devel-
oped as respondents discussed the need to perceive
health through various frameworks (eg, recovery, resili-
ence, human ﬂourishing, quality of life, developmental
and
evolutionary
theories,
cultural
psychiatry
and
ecology). Some respondents noted that current deﬁni-
tions of mental health treat problems of living as
medical problems, rather than adaptive responses to
the conditions that people experience, and that alter-
native explanations should be considered: “An evolu-
tionary approach to these conditions suggests that
anxiety and depression (as responses to social stres-
sors) evolved to help the individual take corrective
action that could ameliorate the negative effects of
these stressors”. Some respondents emphasised that
‘low’ mental health did not equate to mental illness, but
rather a state of hopelessness and lack of personal
autonomy, whereas ‘high’ mental health was demon-
strated by ‘meaningful participation, community citizen-
ship, and life satisfaction’. Others referenced Westerhof
and Keyes’s23 two-continuum model describing mental
illness and mental health as related by two distinct
dimensions.
The Core Concepts of mental health (ﬁgure 1, table 4)
largely described factors relating to the individual—as
opposed to society—that are observed in correlation
with mental health and which are necessary, to some
degree or another, but not normally sufﬁcient on their
own to achieve mental health. Concepts related to
agency, autonomy and control appeared frequently in rela-
tion to an individual’s ability or capacity to effectively
deal with and/or create change in his or her environ-
ment (Directions D–E). Agency/autonomy/control reap-
peared
as
an
essential
component
of
other
core
concepts: agency may be required in order to engage in
meaningful participation (eg, ‘sense of being part of a
vibrant society, with agency to make change for you and
others, and supportive relationships and governance’)
and in dignity (eg, ‘a state of mind that allows one to
lead one’s life knowing that one’s dignity and integrity
as a human being is respected by others’). A cluster of
concepts describing the self signiﬁed (1) the subjective
experience of the individual as fundamental to well-
being and (2) the importance of one’s ability, conﬁ-
dence and desire to live in accordance with one’s own

Core Concepts of mental health
Agency/autonomy/control
“The core concepts of mental health that I find useful are very similar to Amartya Sen’s
conception of “capabilities”—the things a person is able and substantively free to do in
pursuit of a life that the person has reason to value” (ie, Direction C)
“I would say that the positive subjective evaluation of one’s own mental health focuses on
the feeling or belief that one can cope with one’s life circumstances…I hesitate to include a
broader range of negative outcomes since they would be determined by one’s
circumstances (e.g., the amount of control one has in one’s life)…sphere or community
(with the distinction between the two being important primarily to allow for the option of an
isolated existence by choice versus social exclusion)” (ie, Direction D)
Coping with stressors/adapting
to change
“The ability to navigate and adapt to one’s environment seems key…”
“Ability to adapt psychologically to adverse circumstances…a sense of social/emotional
wellness or maturity in the face of life’s vicissitudes (not necessarily happiness, but dealing
with life’s ups and downs in a relatively effective and steady way)”
Balance/stability
“Well-being, with a particular emphasis on resources for living with lucid thinking and
emotional depth and stability” (ie, Direction D)
Meaningful relationships and
participation
“Sense of being part of a vibrant society, with agency to make change for your and others,
and supportive relationships and governance” (ie, Direction E)
“The objective evaluation focuses on one’s ability to participate meaningfully in one’s life
sphere or community (with the distinction between the two being important primarily to
allow for the option of an isolated existence by choice versus social exclusion). However,
meaningful participation is typically defined by local social norms” (ie, Directions D and E)
“Being able to offer some sort of product to the society (where you can get your essentials
to live), to have empathy for another human being and capable of having an intimate and
sustainable affectionate relationship” (ie, Direction E)
Dignity
“A state of mind that allows one to lead one’s life knowing that one’s dignity and integrity as
a human being is respected by others, that in the journey of life one’s diversity of
experiences thereof will be embraced” (ie, Direction D)
Enjoying life/satisfaction/
pleasure
“Mental health is expressed by the ability to enjoy life and love…”
Hope/optimism for Future
“Mental Health is living a hopeful, fulfilling, self-determining life…” (ie, Direction C)
Insight/mindfulness/rational
thought
“Logic and analyzing of scenarios, reflective & reflexive thinking”

esteem, personal and social efﬁcacy, growth, meaning
and purpose, and sense of safety and belonging, and
employment), some also recommended approaches to
achieving social equity (eg, “mental health needs to be
protected by applying antiracism, antioppression, antidis-
crimination lens to prevention and treatment”) (ﬁgure
1, Direction D). A distinct category of human rights devel-
oped from responses to the third open-ended question
(eg, “What is missing?”) (ﬁgure 1). Several respondents
suggested that a basic standard, analogous to a legal def-
inition, is required (table 3) and/or that “a human
rights, political, economic and ecosystem perspective”
should be included.
DISCUSSION
The international exploratory ‘What is Mental Health?’
survey sought the opinions of individuals, across mul-
tiple modes of inquiry, on what they perceived to be the
core concepts of mental health. The survey found dissat-
isfaction with current deﬁnitions of mental health.
There was no consensus among
this
group
on a
common
deﬁnition.
However,
there
was
signiﬁcant
agreement among subcomponents of the deﬁnitions,
speciﬁcally factors beyond the ‘ability to adapt and self-
manage’, such as ‘diversity and community identity’ and
creating distinct deﬁnitions, “one for individual and a
parallel for community and society.” The Core Concepts of
mental health that participants identiﬁed were predom-
inantly centred on factors relating to the individual, and
one’s capacity and ability for choice in interacting with
society. The concepts of agency, autonomy and control were
commonly mentioned throughout the responses, specif-
ically in regard to the individual’s ability or capacity to
effectively deal with and/or create change in his or her
environment. Similarly, respondents pointed to the self as
an essential component of mental health, signifying the
subjective experience of the individual as fundamental
to well-being, particularly in relationship to achieving
one’s valued goals. Respondents suggested that mentally
healthy individuals are socially connected through mean-
ingful participation in valued roles (ie, in family, work,
worship, etc), but that mental health may involve being
able to disconnect by choice, as opposed to being
excluded (eg, having the capacity and ability to reject
social, legal and theological practices). In contrast, Social
and
Environmental
Factors
reﬂected
respondents’
emphasis on factors that are external to the individual
and which can inﬂuence the core concepts of mental
health. Many respondents reiterated the basic necessities
for general health/mental health, similar to the founda-
tions of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,24 and their recom-
mendations for achieving social equity.
Descriptions of the core concepts of mental health
were highly inﬂuenced by respondents’ Positionality and
Paradigms/Theories/Models
of
reference,
which
often
propelled the discourse of “What is mental health?” in
opposing directions. The debate as to whether mental
health and illness are distinct constructs, or points of ref-
erence on a continuum of being, was a common theme.
Respondents were either, adamant in asserting the dis-
tinction between the descriptive or prescriptive nature
of the core concepts, or, ardent in integrating them, pro-
ducing ideas such as describing mental health as a life
free of poverty, discrimination, oppression, human rights
violations and war. Respondents’ made repeated refer-
ences to human rights, suggesting that a basic standard,
analogous to a legal deﬁnition, is required, and that ‘a
human rights, political, economic and ecosystem per-
spective’ should be included. Again, in the tradition of
Hume’s ‘ought–is’ distinction, several respondents cau-
tioned that problems of living, such as ‘poverty, vices
and social injustices…’ should
not be deﬁned ‘as
medical problems’. The signiﬁcance of this issue cannot
be understated: while we asked respondents what the
core concepts of mental health are, overwhelmingly they
answered in terms of what they should be. This ﬁnding is
similar to other issues in public health policy that
address instances of ‘conﬂating scientiﬁc evidence with
moral argument’.15 22 Indeed, a primary criticism of the
WHO deﬁnition of health is that its declaration of “com-
plete physical, mental, and social wellbeing”6 is prescrip-
tive
rather
than
descriptive.15
Such
a
deﬁnition
“contributes
to
the
medicalization
of
society”
and
excludes most people, most of the time, and has little
practical value “because ‘complete’ is neither oper-
ational nor measurable.”15
Accordingly, we propose a transdomain model of health
(ﬁgure 4) to inform the development of a comprehen-
sive deﬁnition for all aspects of health. This model
builds on the three domains of health as described
by WHO6 12 and Huber et al,15 and expands these deﬁni-
tions to include four speciﬁc overlapping areas and the
empirical, moral and legal considerations discussed in
the current study. First, all three domains of health
should have a basic legal standard of functioning and adapta-
tion. Our ﬁndings suggest that for physical health, a
standard level of biological functioning and adaptation
would include allostasis (ie, homeostatic maintenance in
response to stress), whereas for mental health, a standard
level of cognitive–emotional functioning and adaptation
would include sense of coherence (ie, subjective experience
of understanding and managing stressors), similar to
Huber et al’s15 proposal. However, for social health, a
standard level of interpersonal functioning and adaptation
would include interdependence (ie, mutual reliance on,
and responsibility to, others within society), rather than
Huber et al’s15 focus on social participation (ie, balancing
social
and
environmental
challenges).
Our
results
provide further insight into how these domains interact
to affect overall quality of life. Integration of mental and
physical health can be deﬁned by level of autonomy
(ie, the capacity for control over one’s self), whereas inte-
gration of mental and social health can be deﬁned by a

sense of ‘us’ (ie, capacity for relating to others); the inte-
gration of mental and physical health can be deﬁned by
control (ie, capacity for navigating social spaces). The
highest degree of integration would be deﬁned by agency,
the ability to choose one’s level of social participation
(eg, to accept, reject or change social, legal or theological
practices). Such a transdomain model of health could be
useful in developing cross-cultural deﬁnitions of physical,
social and mental health that are both inclusive and
empirically valid. For example, Valliant’s25 seven models for
conceptualizing mental health across cultures are all repre-
sented, to varying degrees, within the proposed transdo-
main model of health. The basic standard of functioning
across domains which is proposed here is congruent with
Valliant’s25 criteria for mental health to be ‘conceptua-
lised as above normal’ and deﬁned in terms of ‘multiple
human strengths rather than the absence of weaknesses’,
including maturity, resilience, positive emotionality and
subjective well-being. In addition, Valliant’s25 conceptual-
isation of mental health as ‘high socio-emotional intelli-
gence’ is also represented in the transdomain model’s
highest level of integration of the three areas for full indi-
vidual autonomy. Finally, Valliant’s25 cautions for deﬁning
positive mental health—being culturally sensitive, recog-
nising that population averages do not equate to individ-
ual normalcy and that state and trait functioning may
overlap, and contextualising mental health in terms of
overall health—are all addressed within the transdomain
model.
Strengths and limitations of the current study
We are unaware of any study to date that has asked this
research question to a group of international experts in
the broad ﬁeld of mental health. Although our survey
sample was small (N=50), it was diverse with regard to
place of origin and expertise; it was also further vali-
dated by participants (N=58) at a day-long conference
on
mental
health
through
discussion,
debate
and
written responses. The current study included global
experts who dedicate their research and professional
lives to advancing the standards of mental health. Of
particular note was that little to no consensus among the
selected group of experts on any particular deﬁnition
was found. In fact, this was simultaneously a limitation
and strength of the study: the small sample size limited
the scope of the core concepts of mental health, but
indicated that it was sufﬁcient to demonstrate that there
are highly divergent deﬁnitions that are largely depend-
ent on the respondents’ frame of reference. It is possible
that saturation was not achieved in regards to the diver-
sity of responses. Further, more than half of the survey
respondents were from Canada, which may have inﬂu-
enced the preference towards the PHAC deﬁnition of
mental health. Although there were advantages to using
a snowball sampling method, another type of sampling
method (eg, cluster sampling, stratiﬁed sampling) may
have resulted in more varied responses to the survey
items. The next logical step would be to survey experts
in countries currently not represented and then ultim-
ately survey members of the general public with regard
to their conceptual and pragmatic understanding of
mental health. One of the a priori objectives for the
survey was to eventually create a consensus deﬁnition of
mental health that could be used in public policy; this
objective was not communicated in the survey, nor did
we actually ask this question. Our results indicate that

of a basic (human rights)
standard of functioning and
adaptation. There are four
dynamic areas of integration or
synergy between domains and
examples of how the core
concepts of mental health could
be used to define them.

ﬁnding consensus on a deﬁnition of mental health will
require much more convergence in the frame of refer-
ence and common language describing components of
mental health. Even we, as authors, have been chal-
lenged by consensus. For example, some of us wish to
emphasise that future work should focus on developing
an operational deﬁnition that can be applied across dis-
ciplines and cultures. Others among us suggest further
exploring what purpose a deﬁnition of mental health
would or should serve, and why. In contrast, others
among us wish to emphasise the process of conceptualis-
ing mental health versus the outcome or application of
such a deﬁnition. What we hoped would be a straightfor-
ward, simple question, designed to create consensus for
a deﬁnition of mental health, ultimately demonstrated
the nuanced but crucial epistemological and empirical
inﬂuences on the understanding of mental health.
Based on the results of the survey and conference, we
present a preliminary model for conceptualising mental
health. Our study provides evidence that if we are to try
to come to a common consensus on a deﬁnition of
mental health, we will need to understand the frame of
reference of those involved and try to parse out the
paradigms, positionality and the social/environmental
factors that are offered from the core concepts we make
seek to describe. Future work may also need to distin-
guish between the scientiﬁc evidence of mental health and
the arguments for mental health. Similar debates in bioeth-
ics22 26–28 demonstrate the theoretical and practical lim-
itations of science for proscribing human behaviour,
especially with regard to individual freedom and social
justice.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that any practical use of a deﬁnition
of health will depend on the epistemological and moral
framework through which it was developed, and that the
mental and social domains may be differentially inﬂu-
enced than the physical domain. A deﬁnition of health,
grounded solely in biology, may be more applicable
across diverse populations. A deﬁnition of health encom-
passing the mental and social domains may vary more in
application, particularly across systems, cultures or clin-
ical practices that differ in values (eg, spiritual, religious)
and ways of understanding and being (eg, epistemol-
ogy). A universal (global) deﬁnition based on the phys-
ical domain could be parsed out separately from several
unique (local) deﬁnitions based on the mental and
social domains. Understanding the history and evolution
of the concept of mental health is essential to under-
standing the problems it was intended to solve, and what
it may be used for in the future.

Abstract: Climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations. This scoping
review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the
World Health Organisation’s (WHO) ﬁve global research priorities for protecting human health from
climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental
health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies
where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identiﬁed 120 original studies published
between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in
high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the ﬁrst of the WHO global research priorities—
assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related
exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildﬁres, and ﬂoods were associated with
psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing
mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few
studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate
change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support
(n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly
growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based
mitigation and adaptation strategies.

1. Introduction
In 2009, a Lancet Commission on Climate Change asserted that “climate change is the
biggest global health threat of the 21st century” [1]. In response, the ‘Lancet Countdown
on health and climate change’ has been established as an independent, global monitoring
system dedicated to tracking the health dimensions of the impacts of, and the response to,
climate change [2]. While the Lancet Countdown includes numerous health indicators, it
currently lacks an indicator capable of capturing the impact of climate change on mental
health globally. This lack of representation in global climate and health initiatives is of
considerable concern, as mental disorders are a leading cause of burden of disease globally
and contribute to increased rates of premature mortality [3].

Climate change is expected to impact mental health via a range of direct and indirect
pathways [4]. Direct pathways include exposure to traumatic events, such as bushﬁres
and other severe weather-related events. Indirect pathways largely operate through a
range of social, political, and economic determinants of mental health such as poverty,
unemployment, and housing. Vulnerable people and places, especially in low-income
countries, are anticipated to be particularly badly impacted [4].
Three recent reviews have attempted to synthesise the existing literature on climate
change and mental health. Middleton et al., have explored the mental health impacts of
climate change among Indigenous Peoples, populations in which climate change impacts
are anticipated to be ampliﬁed [5]. Hayes et al. conducted a scoping review to explore
an important question of how mental health might be integrated into climate change and
health vulnerability assessments [6]. Cianconi et al. examined the association between
climate change-related events and mental health; however, the review did not assess the
quality of these studies [7]. Yet, assessing the quality of studies in such a novel and growing
area of research is critical, as it helps identify research gaps and methodological issues that
will help formulate recommendations for future studies.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed ﬁve global research priorities
for protecting human health from climate change: assessing the risks; identifying the most
effective interventions; guiding health-promoting mitigation and adaptation decisions in
other sectors; improving decision-support; and estimating the costs of protecting health
from climate change [8]. Currently, there has only been the assessment of the evidence base
across the ﬁrst of these ﬁve research priority areas (assessing the risks).
Building upon existing reviews, this scoping review aims to assess the available
literature and explore the key literature gaps, related to climate change and mental health
across WHO’s ﬁve global research priorities for protecting human health from climate
change. This is essential in order to understand the current gaps in the literature and
inform future research priorities.
2. Methods
2.1. Scoping Review
This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [9] in conjunction with the PRISMA Extension
for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [10]. To identify original research studies related to
mental health and climate change, the following online databases were searched from
1 January 2001, to 31 December 2020: PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of
Science, and Scopus. The PubMed search string (Box 1) was adapted for each database
(search strings for each database can be found in the Appendix A). Whilst acknowledging
there are other relevant and broader constructs of mental health, such as ‘emotional
wellbeing’, we elected to constrain our search terms to draw a boundary around an
otherwise unmanageable number of references. Additional studies were identiﬁed by
examining the reference lists of key review articles. Three authors (F.C., S.A., and M.P.)
independently conducted title/abstract and full-text screening using Endnote X9, and two
authors (SA, M.P.) independently extracted data from studies that met the inclusion criteria
into a Microsoft Excel sheet. Consensus was sought among these authors throughout
this process.
The inclusion criteria were as follows:
•
Must relate to mental health and climate change across one or more of the domains
deﬁned by the Lancet Countdown for Health and Climate Change 2018 [11]: climate
change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for
health; mitigation actions and health co-beneﬁts; ﬁnance and economics; and public
and political engagement
•
Must be original research (e.g., cross-sectional or cohort studies)
•
Publication year must be from 2001 onwards
•

2.2. Quality Assessment
The same three authors (F.C., S.A., and M.P.) assessed all studies for which appropriate
quality assessment tools were available (n = 93). We used the ‘Observational Cohort and
Cross-Sectional Studies’ and ‘Case Series Studies’ Quality Assessment tools from the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [12]. The NHLBI tools were robustly
developed and include individualised tools for a range of study designs (e.g., cohort,
cross-sectional, case series). Qualitative studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal
Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Checklist [13]. Ecological studies were evaluated
using a scale adapted from Cortes-Ramirez et al. [14], with the “sample size” and “validity
of statistical inferences” criteria removed as their speciﬁcity was not deemed relevant to
providing an overall quality assessment of the studies included in the review. We did not
assess the quality of studies employing modelling, case report, time-series, case-crossover,
panel, or other unique study designs due to the lack of appropriate quality assessment tools.
Studies were assessed as either ‘poor’, ‘fair, or ‘good’, guided by a series of questions
set by the quality assessment tools. The ﬁndings of ‘poor’ quality studies were excluded
from our synthesis of results but can be found listed in Table A1.
2.3. Research Framework
Studies were grouped by a member of the team under the ﬁve global research priorities
for protecting health from climate change proposed by the World Health Organization:
assessing the risks; identifying the most effective interventions; guiding health-promoting
mitigation and adaptation decisions in other sectors; improving decision-support; and
estimating the costs of protecting health from climate change [8]. Further information
about the WHO framework can be found in Appendix A.
2.4. Figure Preparation
The PRISMA ﬂow diagram was prepared using PRISMA2020: R package and ShinyApp
for producing PRISMA 2020 compliant ﬂow diagrams (Version 0.0.1) [15]. The world
map was created using the rworldmap package (version 1.3-6) [16] in RStudio (version
1.3.1093) [17] with R 4.0.3 [18]. The graph of studies over time was also created in RStudio
using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3) [19].
3. Results
We identiﬁed 120 original research studies that examined mental health in the context
of climate change-related exposures (Figure 1). Sixty-seven studies reported quantitative
data, 34 reported qualitative data, and 19 reported a combination of qualitative and quanti-
tative data. The most common study design was cross-sectional (n = 42), followed by case
studies (n = 28), modelling studies (n = 12), ecological studies (n = 7) and cohort studies
(n = 7). Table A1 provides a summary of the included studies.

The following sections provide a narrative summary of the original research corr
sponding to the WHO framework. 
3.1. Assessing the Risks 
The majority of studies (n = 101 out of 120) examined the mental health risks pose
by climate change. The literature linked mental health outcomes to several climate-relate
exposures—heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods. Other environment
exposures, such as tropical cyclones and storms, were not included as no studies we
found that explicitly referred to climate change. This section will present studies accor
ing to the following three categories (which are not mutually exclusive): (1) environment
exposures; (2) mental health outcomes; and (3) specific sub-groups and contexts th
might be particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change on mental health. 
3.2. Environmental Exposures 
3.2.1. Temperature and Humidity 
The most commonly examined environmental exposure in relation to health risk w
temperature (n = 27), which was often measured alongside other meteorological variabl
such as humidity and rainfall. In most studies, an increase in temperature was positive
correlated with poor mental health outcomes. 
Three studies from Australia found associations between heat and mental health ou
comes; however, the evidence was inconsistent. For example, Ding et al., report that

The following sections provide a narrative summary of the original research corre-
sponding to the WHO framework.
3.1. Assessing the Risks
The majority of studies (n = 101 out of 120) examined the mental health risks posed by
climate change. The literature linked mental health outcomes to several climate-related
exposures—heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildﬁres, and ﬂoods. Other environmental
exposures, such as tropical cyclones and storms, were not included as no studies were
found that explicitly referred to climate change. This section will present studies according
to the following three categories (which are not mutually exclusive): (1) environmental
exposures; (2) mental health outcomes; and (3) speciﬁc sub-groups and contexts that might
be particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change on mental health.
3.2. Environmental Exposures
3.2.1. Temperature and Humidity
The most commonly examined environmental exposure in relation to health risk was
temperature (n = 27), which was often measured alongside other meteorological variables
such as humidity and rainfall. In most studies, an increase in temperature was positively
correlated with poor mental health outcomes.
Three studies from Australia found associations between heat and mental health
outcomes; however, the evidence was inconsistent. For example, Ding et al., report that
an increase in temperature and humidity affects psychological distress, independently
from pre-existing depression or anxiety [20]. Similarly, another study that looked at data
from Adelaide, Australia, found that while there was a positive association between
temperatures exceeding the maximum and minimum thresholds (32 ◦C and 16 ◦C) and
psychiatric presentations to the emergency department, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in
this effect when temperatures were considered extreme [21]. A third study conducted on
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486
6 of 38
children in Australia showed a small effect of worsened childhood mental health with an
increase in annual average daily maximum temperatures [22].
Several studies from Asia found that ﬂuctuating temperatures inﬂuenced mental
health and well-being, impacting productivity and livelihoods [23–25]. Long-term exposure
to high and low temperatures in Taiwan resulted in a 7% increase of major depressive
disorder incidence per 1 ◦C increment in regions with an average annual temperature
above the median 23 ◦C. A higher incidence was found in the older age group (65+ years),
with a slightly higher hazard ratio for males in this group, and females in the younger age
group (20–64 years) [26].
Temperature also affected mental health and well-being in several studies conducted
in North America. Noelke et al. reported that temperatures above daily averages reduced
positive emotions like happiness, increased negative emotions like anger and stress, and
increased fatigue [27]. Another study found that monthly temperatures above 30 ◦C
increased the probability of mental health difﬁculties by 0.5%, and ongoing exposure to
increasing temperatures (1 ◦C over ﬁve years) was associated with a 2% increase in the
prevalence of mental health issues [28]. High ambient temperatures were also found to
increase help-seeking for mental health, such as crisis text line usage in young adults
in several urban areas in the United States [29]. A study exploring protective factors in
the context of extreme seasonal weather in Tennessee, USA found that social cohesion
was associated with reduced mental health impacts among low- and moderate-income
residents [30].
3.2.2. Drought and Rainfall
Drought was another frequently studied climate exposure (n = 16). All but one of the
studies were from Australia and primarily focussed on rural communities. Almost half of
these studies were based on large, longitudinal studies and utilised standard mental health
measures such as the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). A nationally representative
cross-sectional survey of Australian residents found that while drought was associated
with elevated psychological distress (as measured by the K10) in rural communities, this
was not the case for urban dwellers [31].
A longitudinal cohort study showed elevated drought-related stress and psycho-
logical distress (as measured by the K10) among farmers [32]. Drought-related stress,
which captures worry about the impacts of drought on themselves and their families and
communities, was inﬂuenced by socio-demographic and community factors (e.g., loss,
government compliance pressures, and difﬁculties accessing mental health support or
receiving inappropriate mental health services) that differed from the factors that inﬂu-
enced psychological distress [33]. Factors associated with higher psychological distress
included being unemployed and exposure to other adverse life events, while protective
factors included ﬁnancial security, social support, and a sense of community [32,34]. The
evidence for differential impacts on gender and age is conﬂicting [35–37].
One multi-country study has looked at rainfall as a climate-related exposure and has
reported that the highest prevalence of mood disorders is observed in countries charac-
terised by small variations across monthly rainfall and high levels of rainfall [38].
3.2.3. Wildﬁre
Two studies from North America examined the impacts of wildﬁres on mental health.
Qualitative interviews of people purposively sampled to include a broad cross-section
of backgrounds and experiences from a severe 2014 wildﬁre season in the North-West
Territories of Canada, in the context of climate change, reported how experiences of
evacuation and isolation, as well as feelings of fear, stress, and uncertainty, contributed to
acute and long-term negative impacts on mental and emotional well-being [39]. Prolonged
smoke events were linked to respiratory problems, extended time indoors, and disruptions
to livelihood and land-based activities, which negatively affected mental well-being [39].
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486

A household study conducted one year after the Wallow Fire in Arizona, United States,
concluded higher solastalgia, a term used to indicate distress caused by environmental
change (measured using a scale adapted from [40]), and an adverse ﬁnancial impact of
the ﬁre was associated with clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress (as measured
by the K10). In contrast, a higher family functioning score was associated with less
psychological distress [41]. Other countries that experience regular wildﬁres, such as
Australia, referred to as bushﬁres, had no research exploring mental health impacts in the
context of climate change.
3.2.4. Flood
Several studies examined the mental health impacts of ﬂooding. An Australian study
qualitatively explored individuals’ experiences from rural communities, concluding that
the threat of drought and ﬂood are intertwined and contributed to decreased well-being
from stress, anxiety, loss, and fear [42]. A cohort study from the UK looking at the long-term
impact of ﬂooding found psychological morbidity persisted for at least three years after
the ﬂooding event [43].
In addition to the tangible mental health impacts related to exposure to speciﬁc
climate change-related events, studies have reported psychological impacts of perceived
risks associated with climate change [44,45].
3.3. Mental Health Outcomes
3.3.1. Symptom Scales and Screening Tools
Symptom scales were commonly used to examine mental health outcomes. Distress
(n = 17) was one of the most investigated outcomes; primarily psychological distress
measured using the K10. Some studies attempted to develop speciﬁc environmental
distress measures, including a scale for solastalgia and a speciﬁc ‘climate change dis-
tress’ scale [41,46–48].
Four studies used validated screening tools for mental disor-
ders [39,41,45,46]. Only one study used a structured diagnostic instrument to determine
mental disorder diagnoses [49].
3.3.2. Hospital Admissions
Alternatively, many studies utilised routinely collected administrative data. Psychi-
atric hospital admissions associated with temperature and heat waves were frequently
studied (n = 15). These studies demonstrate a positive association, particularly with ele-
vated temperatures, with susceptibility varying in terms of demographic variables (e.g.,
older people shown to be at higher risk) [50,51] and type of disorder (e.g., organic disorders
such as dementia) [52]. The relationship between hospital admissions and heat has been
examined for a range of mental and neurological disorders, including dementia, mood
disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, somatoform disorders, and
disorders of psychological development [52–54].
3.3.3. Mortality
Mortality has also been found to be inﬂuenced by high ambient temperatures for
people living with mental illness and neurological conditions. A study of health outcome
data from Adelaide, South Australia, for 1993–2006, has demonstrated that mortality
attributed to mental and behavioural disorders increased during heat waves in the 65-
to 74-years age group and in persons with psychosis [52,55]. Another European study
supports this ﬁnding with increased mortality risk for people with psychiatric disorders
during heat waves from 2000 to 2008 in Rome and Stockholm, particularly for older
people (75+) and women. A study from England found that primary care patients with
psychosis, dementia, and alcohol or substance misuse experienced signiﬁcantly higher heat-
related mortality above regionally deﬁned temperature thresholds. This effect was more
marked for younger patients and those with a primary diagnosis of alcohol or substance
misuse [56,57]. Nitschke et al., found a small increase in mental health-related mortality in
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486
8 of 38
people aged 65–74 years during heat waves in metropolitan Adelaide [58]. Projections of
mortality under different climate change scenarios in China also estimate increasing trends
in heat-related excess mortality for mental disorders but a decreasing trend in cold-related
excess mortality [59].
3.3.4. Self-Harm
Temperature has also been associated with self-harm and suicide rates [60–64]. Data
from Finland found that temperature variability explained more than 60% of the total
suicide variance over several decades [62]. Using data from the US and Mexico, suicide
rates were found to increase by 0.7% and 3.1%, respectively, for a 1 ◦C increase in monthly
average temperature, with unmitigated climate change projected to result in a combined
21,770 (95% CI 8950–39,260) additional suicides by 2050 [64].
3.3.5. Burden of Disease
Studies attempting to quantify the burden of mental disorders attributable to climate
change are sparse. One study from South Korea has estimated the burden of disease related
to climate change for a range of conditions and climate-related measures, including PTSD,
as an outcome of disasters [65]. Unfortunately, this study was limited in several ways,
including a lack of availability of input data.
3.4. Vulnerable Populations and Life Stages
3.4.1. Pre-existing Mental Illness
We identiﬁed a body of research related to populations and contexts that are antici-
pated to be more vulnerable to climate change and its mental health impacts. People taking
certain psychotropic medications (including hypnotics, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics) are
at increased risk of heatstroke and death as a result of high temperatures, possibly due to
disruptions in thermoregulation triggered by some psychotropic medications [56,66]. One
study from Australia showed that people living with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
experience obsessions and compulsions directly aligned with climate change concerns [67].
3.4.2. Youth
According to the results of a national survey of Australian children aged 6–11, higher
temperatures may impact children’s mental health [22]. Youth affected by drought may
also experience cumulative mental health impacts [68].
3.4.3. Indigenous People
Qualitative studies reporting the unique mental health impacts of climate change
on Inuit communities in Canada have described a loss of place-based solace, land-based
activities such as hunting, and cultural identity due to changing weather and local land-
scapes [69,70]. Changes in sea ice stability and surface area are of particular cultural
concern for Inuit [71]. Studies among these communities report that climate and envi-
ronmental changes increase family stress, enhance the possibility of increased drug and
alcohol use, amplify previous traumas and mental health stressors, and may increase the
risk of suicidal ideation [72]. Indigenous communities from Alaska have also expressed
signiﬁcant concern for climate change and its impacts on local sustenance resources, such
as berries [73]. Mental health, physical health, traditional/western education, access to
country food and store-bought foods, access to ﬁnancial resources, social networks, and
connection to Inuit identity emerged as key components of Inuit adaptive capacity in the
face of climate change [74]. Studies conducted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples from Australia also highlight the environmental impacts of climate change on
emotional wellbeing, including increased community distress from deteriorating the con-
nection to country [75,76]. Heat also appeared to be associated with suicide incidence in
Australia’s Indigenous populations; however, other socio-demographic factors may play a
more critical role than meteorological factors [77].

3.4.4. Low- and Middle-Income Countries
A study from Ethiopia, a low-income country that has a high dependency on the local
environment to meet basic human and animal needs, demonstrated that seasonal envi-
ronmental changes related to water security expose populations to signiﬁcant emotional
distress [78]. Small island developing states in the Paciﬁc Ocean have been deemed to be
particularly at risk and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Low-lying villages in
the Solomon Islands in the South Paciﬁc report that sea-level rise causes fear and worry
on a personal and community level [79]. Research from Tuvalu, another small Paciﬁc
Island experiencing the threat of sea-level rise, describes the individual experiences of
distress in the face of climate change and underscores the necessity to provide access to
culturally informed social and mental health services in the region [80]. Three studies
from Bangladesh have reported negative effects on emotional well-being as a result of
climate-induced immobility [81–83].
3.5. Identifying the Most Effective Interventions
There were eight studies related to interventions; however, these were primarily
exploratory and qualitative and focused on health professionals and community settings,
and did not provide clear support for any one speciﬁc intervention.
One study looked at the health and social service responses to the long-term mental
health impacts of a ﬂood event. It concluded that sustained recovery interventions rooted in
local knowledge and interdisciplinary action were required and that there are unintended
consequences related to psychosocial interventions that can incite complex emotions and
impact psychosocial recovery [84].
A study from rural Australia has described how a community development model, in-
corporating elements of health promotion, education, and early intervention, was accepted
and considered effective in helping communities build capacity and resilience in the face
of chronic drought-related hardship [85]. Unfortunately, this study did not measure the
intervention’s impact on the mental health status of participants. Another Australian study
that focused on rural health service managers found that 90% of respondents perceived
climate change as likely to impact mental health and highlighted the important role of rural
health services in education and advocacy on climate change’s health impacts [86]. A case
study of health promotion practices that address climate change in Victorian (Australia)
healthcare settings found that community gardens improved social connectedness and
mental and physical health [87]. Results of a study from Canada revealed the need for
improved medical education on climate change and health, including mental health, sug-
gesting that a 3-h education activity would be useful and would allow family physicians to
use this knowledge in their daily practice, notably through prevention and counselling [88].
Two studies explored the relationship between pro-environmental behaviour and
mental health in terms of awareness of health risks and potential health co-beneﬁts. Results
from a survey in China indicated that residents’ health-risk perception is positively affected
by climate-change information. Additionally, perceiving climate change as detrimental to
mental health was shown to inﬂuence a residents’ attitude and intention to take environ-
mental action more than physical health-risk perception [89]. A study of UK households
found that while individual-level pro-environmental attitudes were negatively associated
with mental health, household pro-environmental behaviours and attitudes of other house-
hold members were associated with positive outcomes, pointing towards a role of social
capital and the household level as an important target for interventions [90].
Finally, a study exploring health perceptions in climate-driven migrants found that
emphasis was placed on the importance of mental health, indicating that mental health
interventions could be effective in this population [91].
3.6. Guiding Health-Promoting Mitigation and Adaptation Decisions in Other Sectors
A small number of studies (n = 7) examined how sectors outside of health can mitigate
and adapt to reduce climate change impacts on mental health. Three of these studies
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486
10 of 38
were from Inuit communities. Social and environmental factors that may protect mental
health and wellbeing were highlighted, including being on the land and connecting to
Inuit culture, as well as how Inuit-led monitoring of environmental conditions can guide
climate change adaptation that considers intangible losses and damages to well-being and
ways of living [92–94]. A study from Nepal revealed similar themes [95], while a 15-year
prospective cohort study of Hurricane Katrina survivors (New Orleans, LA, USA) has
concluded that mitigation efforts should prevent trauma exposure through investments in
climate resilience and eliminating evacuation impediments [96].
Barriers to implementing strategies to adapt to combat the agricultural impacts of
climate change have resulted in negative mental health outcomes among subsistence
farmers in Burkina Faso [97]. Barriers comprised ﬁnancial and time constraints, material
and labour shortages, and inaccessible information; however, awareness of climate change
was also reported to be limited.
Finally, an exploratory study surveying people affected by widespread public safety
power shutoffs (PSPS) to reduce the risk of wildﬁres in California found that while people
were mostly supportive of PSPS as an adaptation measure, it was associated with poorer
physical and mental health [98].
3.7. Improving Decision-Support
Very few studies (n = 3) reported issues that could support improved decision-making
around mental health and climate change. Between 2010 and 2012, the WHO Division of
Paciﬁc Technical Support led a regional climate change and health vulnerability assessment
and adaptation planning project in collaboration with health sector partners in 13 Paciﬁc Is-
land countries. Mental health was identiﬁed as a high-priority climate-sensitive health risk
in eight out of the 13 countries [99]. However, another study found that policy documents
on climate change from 12 countries made little or no reference to nine vulnerable groups,
including people with mental illness [100].
A study designed to develop and validate indices of adaptation to ﬂooding found that
people who perceived a risk of ﬂooding in their home in the next ﬁve years adopted more
preventative behaviours and adaptation behaviours than those who perceived little or no
risk at all. Additionally, people who felt more adverse effects of ﬂooding on their physical
or mental health tended to adopt more adaptive behaviours than those who felt little or no
adverse effects on their health [101].
3.8. Estimating the Costs of Protecting Health from Climate Change
We did not ﬁnd any studies that assessed the costs associated with climate change
impacts on mental health. However, one study from the United Kingdom found that a
social prescribing service for mental health—a service model which supports people to
access healthcare resources and psychosocial support, considered to hold potential for
reduced cost and carbon-footprint—was associated with reduced ﬁnancial costs but an
increased carbon footprint per patient. However, none of the differences between groups
reached statistical signiﬁcance [102].
3.9. Quality of Studies
Overall, the studies identiﬁed in this review were of sound (fair to good) quality. Out
of the 93 studies that were quality assessed, 75% were rated good, 23% fair and 2% poor. It
is important to note that we found signiﬁcant variability in how environmental exposures
were measured. Among the quantitative studies, we identiﬁed two types of approaches to
measure exposure to climate-sensitive environmental hazards: (i) self-reported exposures
using questionnaires and interviews (note that all qualitative studies used self-reported
exposures) and (ii) interpolated exposures using external sources of data.
Fifty-two studies relied on self-reported information to assign a climate change-related
exposure to study participants. We found large variability across the survey questions used
to capture self-reported exposures, as no standardised questionnaire exists (in contrast to
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486
11 of 38
self-reported mental health outcomes) to measure subjective experience regarding climate-
sensitive environmental hazards. Speciﬁcally, each study in our selected sample used a
different question or metric to capture the environmental exposure. Such variability makes
the evaluation of the robustness of used tools and the comparison between studies difﬁcult.
To the best of our knowledge, we did not identify any self-reported tool regarding the
exposures of interest that were validated beforehand.
In addition, 48 studies relied on interpolated exposures using various types of available
meteorological data sources. Some studies used meteorological data (mostly precipitation
and temperature) from monitoring stations in the area of interest, often retrieved from the
national or regional bureau of meteorology or data service centres. Other studies relied on
remote sensing data from various satellite products with reanalysis, including the PRISM
Climate Group [103] or the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Dataset [104]. While some
studies used the meteorological variable directly in their analysis, such as daily maximum
temperature, others further calculated indices or metrics to deﬁne weather events such as
drought and heat waves. Most studies used the ﬁnest spatial resolution that was available
while some used large-scale measurements when assigning exposure to meteorological
variables, which may lead to important misclassiﬁcation biases and impact effect estimates
of interest. Indeed, assigning the same exposure to temperature, for example, on a given
day to all individuals in a country or region is unlikely to accurately represent individuals’
exposure given well-documented local variations in microclimates [105,106]. We also found
differences in the temporal scales that were used across studies. While most studies relied
on daily estimates to capture acute effects on mental health outcomes, other studies used
monthly or annual estimates to capture chronic impacts, describing various mechanisms
such as economic insecurity or migration. Finally, some studies provided limited details
regarding data sources and how indices were calculated, making it difﬁcult to understand
how exposures were estimated and hindering reproducibility efforts.
4. Discussion
This scoping review is the ﬁrst to explore the existing original research literature that
investigates climate change and mental health using WHO’s global research priorities
as a framework [8]. We identiﬁed 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020
that speciﬁcally referenced climate change impacts, adaptation, mitigation, and other
interventions relevant to mental health. Most studies were quantitative, used a cross-
sectional design, were conducted in high-income countries, and were concerned with
assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change-related exposures.
The literature consistently points to the negative associations that climate change-
related events have with individuals’ and communities’ mental health. Climate change-
related events were shown to be associated with psychological distress, worsened mental
health (particularly among people with pre-existing mental health conditions), increased
psychiatric hospitalisations, higher mortality among people with mental illness, and height-
ened suicide rates. These results are largely in line with the detrimental impacts that
climate change has been shown to have on many other aspects of health [2].
While the overwhelming focus on the mental health risks of climate change is un-
derstandable and has generated insight and traction for advocating the importance of
considering mental health within climate change, only four studies have focused on protec-
tive factors or the coping mechanisms people and communities have used when responding
to the detrimental mental health impacts of climate change [26,38,90,105]. An in-depth
understanding of which factors constitute ‘resilience’ in the face of climate change would
contribute to a more nuanced picture of the associations between climate change and
mental health [107] and could be useful when devising programs and policies for those
most heavily impacted by climate change.
Additionally, the focus on characterising and quantifying the linkages between climate
change and mental health has not been matched by applied research on addressing and
reducing these associated mental health risks [8]. Future work should investigate more
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486
12 of 38
systematically the possible effectiveness, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of interventions
and policies aimed at safeguarding mental health in the face of climate change, including
non-mental health interventions. Various health professionals, including nurses [108], emer-
gency department clinicians [109,110], clinical psychologists, and psychiatrists [111,112],
have already outlined ways to address mental health problems related to climate change
within clinical practice and broader policy, highlighting the strong willingness to act in the
medical community. There is also a growing movement of climate advocacy in the health
sector, recognising the responsibility to protect the health of current and future generations
and calling for meaningful government action [113].
The current review points to some important avenues for future research. As men-
tioned above, one key research priority is to dissect the association between mental health
and climate change by investigating possible mediators and moderators as well as risk,
vulnerability, and resilience factors in different populations. A systems-thinking approach,
as advocated by Berry et al., might be particularly suitable for this endeavour [114]. This
will be aided by more precise operationalization and conceptualization of environmental
and mental health variables in the climate change space, another important research prior-
ity. Recent work to devise precise measurement instruments for constructs such as climate
anxiety [115] represents an important step in this direction. Additionally, in order to move
beyond the assessment of risk, other important research priorities relate to understanding
how climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies might impact mental health and
wellbeing [98] and how engagement in different types of pro-environmental behaviours
such as climate activism might impact mental health [116]. A more comprehensive discus-
sion of future directions in climate change and mental health research and practice will be
covered in a separate paper by the authors.
The current review has a number of implications for policymakers and intergovern-
mental organizations such as the World Health Organization. While WHO is increasingly
directing its attention to the health impacts of climate change, mental health has gener-
ally remained absent from these conversations. For example, as part of the Health and
Climate Change Country Proﬁle Project WHO 2019–2020 cycle, WHO reported that only
three (i.e., Antigua and Barbuda, United Arab Emirates, and Solomon Islands) out of the
10 recently reviewed countries included mental health and well-being outcomes as part of
their climate-sensitive health outcomes monitoring systems [117]. This is in stark contrast
with other conditions such as vector-borne and waterborne disease, for which monitoring
systems were in place for nine out of the 10 recently reviewed countries. The current review
highlights the need for monitoring systems to systematically include mental health as part
of their indicators in order to ensure precise monitoring and availability of data at the
national level. Additionally, it indicates the importance of including climate change as an
important determinant of mental health in policy documentation and action plans, such
as in the future extension of the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020 [118] to 2030.
Importantly, future work might want to explore whether existing WHO documentation and
intervention plans for humanitarian settings such as the mhGAP-HIG [119], the Building
Back Better framework [120], and scalable psychological interventions [121] are applicable
in the context of climate change or whether more speciﬁc adaptations are needed. Finally,
WHO’s recent work on the integration of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)
within disaster risk reduction efforts [122] might represent an important opportunity to
integrate climate change within MHPSS.
Palinkas et al. have reviewed the preparedness and response strategies from a mental
health services perspective across three areas: (1) acute and extreme weather events; (2)
sub-acute or long-term events; and (3) the prospect of long-term and permanent changes,
such as an uninhabitable physical environment [122,123]. It is these long-term impacts,
in particular, which may demand a shift in attention, as we found only one study which
examined the mental health impacts of more general and permanent environmental degra-
dation [124].
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486

A substantial limitation in the surveyed literature concerns the under-representation
of research from low- and middle-income countries. The majority of studies identiﬁed
in this review were conducted in Australia, Canada, and the US. However, evidence
indicates that low- and middle-income countries are more at risk of climate change-
related events and have fewer resources to respond to these stressors due to pre-existing
vulnerabilities [125,126]. For example, according to the Climate Change Vulnerability In-
dex, the ﬁve most vulnerable countries in the face of climate change globally in 2016 were
Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, and South Sudan,
all low-income countries considered at “extreme risk” in the face of climate change [127].
These vulnerable regions and populations are among the least responsible for the green-
house gases that are warming the planet. The concept of climate justice highlights this
double inequality of climate change, where there is an inverse distribution between risk
and responsibility [128].
A possible limitation of the current study is that the search strategy used means that
studies were included only if the authors explicitly linked the climate-related stressor
they were considering and climate change. Indeed, a large amount of literature exists
concerning the association between disasters and mental health [129] (without explicitly
linking an increase in frequency and severity to climate change) which is likely to add
value to the ﬁeld. The geographical origin of the literature reviewed in the current paper
is skewed towards high-income countries and unrepresentative of many regions of the
world. The reasons for the relative abundance of research in countries such as Australia is
worth exploring. Perhaps one reason for an under-representation of research from certain
regions is that we only assessed studies in English. The decision to not explore non-English
studies was related to our limited resources and capacity combined with the anticipation
this extended search would yield limited studies.
It is also important to acknowledge that existing quality assessment tools are largely
subjective and not perfectly adapted to the designs of studies included in this review
and we were not able to assess the quality of studies employing modelling, case report,
time-series, case-crossover, panel, or other unique study designs. Overall, our quality
assessments highlight a need for improvement in future research—notably concerning
improved measures of environmental exposures and mental health outcomes. For example,
assessing the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of self-reported tools, for a given context and a
given environmental hazard exposure, would be beneﬁcial for assessing the reliability of
such tools and allowing comparison across populations and studies.
The increasing number of studies on climate change and mental health parallels
the growing traction in the broader ﬁeld of climate change and health. Since 2007, the
academic literature on this topic has tripled and media reports have increased by 78% [130].
However, mental health remains in a secondary position to physical health concerns,
reﬂecting the state of global mental health more generally—despite research advances,
the substantial burden of disease attributable to mental disorders has not improved, the
quality of mental health services is routinely worse than services for physical health and
government investment remains extremely limited [131]. This neglect is apparent in our
ﬁndings and results in a continued lack of progress in improving the mental health of
populations. The inattention to climate change impacts on mental health found in our
scoping review echoes that noted by the Lancet Countdown report in 2018 [130]. This
report noted that of the 16 national health adaptation strategies reviewed, mental health
was the least considered climate-sensitive health outcome (mentioned by ﬁve out of 16
national health adaptation strategies).
5. Conclusions
The current scoping review has shown that climate change and mental health repre-
sents a rapidly growing area of research; however, it is underdeveloped and will need to
accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation
strategies. Most of the research has been devoted to assessing the mental health risks due to
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4486
14 of 38
climate change, with less applied research investigating practical issues such as identifying
the most effective interventions and policies to safeguard mental health in the face of
climate change. Most of the research conducted to date is quantitative, cross-sectional,
and conducted in high-income countries—therefore somewhat limiting the interpretability
and the generalisability of the ﬁndings. Despite these limitations, the existing evidence
overwhelmingly points to a negative association between climate change and mental health.
Future research should aim at producing more robust and methodologically sound evi-
dence on the link between mental health and climate change while also bearing in mind the
importance of investigating what interventions, policies, and decision-making mechanisms
can be put in place to mitigate the mental health impacts of climate change. This should
represent a key priority in mental health research as, just like with physical health, climate
change represents the biggest global threat to mental health of the 21st century [1].

In 2022, the WHO launched another world MH report and reaffirmed the 10 recommendations, while concluding that 'business as usual for MH will simply not do' without higher infusions of money. This paper suggests the reason for so little change over the last 20 years is due to the importation and imposition of Western MH models and frameworks of training, service development and research on the assumption they are relevant and acceptable to Africans in LAMICs. This ignores the fact that most mental and physical primary care occurs within local non-Western traditions of healthcare that are dismissed and assumed irrelevant by Western frameworks. These trusted local institutions of healthcare that operate in homes and spiritual spaces are in tune with the lives and culture of local people. We propose that Western foundations of MH knowledge are not universal nor are their assumptions of society globally applicable. Real change in the MH of LAMICs requires reimagining. Local idioms of distress and healing, and explanatory models of suffering within particular populations, are needed to guide the development of training curricula, research and services. An integration of Western frameworks into these more successful approaches are more likely to contribute to the betterment of MH for peoples in LAMICs.",

abstract
Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 1 of the most common
neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and can profoundly affect children’s
academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions. The American Academy
of Pediatrics ﬁrst published clinical recommendations for evaluation and
diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed
in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying
process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by
which clinicians could fulﬁll the clinical guideline’s recommendations. Since the
release of the 2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders has been revised to the ﬁfth edition, and new ADHD-related research
has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to
the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates have been
made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement
related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and
adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also
been updated to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations.
Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, numerous
systemic barriers were identiﬁed that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians’
ability to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created
a companion article (available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic
barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD, which identiﬁes the
major systemic-level barriers and presents recommendations to address those
barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the clinical practice
guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.

INTRODUCTION
This article updates and replaces the
2011 clinical practice guideline
revision published by the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), “Clinical
Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and
Evaluation of the Child with
Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder.”1 This guideline, like the
previous document, addresses the
evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment
of attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) in children from age
4 years to their 18th birthday, with
special guidance provided for ADHD
care for preschool-aged children and
adolescents. (Note that for the
purposes of this document,
“preschool-aged” refers to children
from age 4 years to the sixth
birthday.) Pediatricians and other
primary care clinicians (PCCs) may
continue to provide care after
18 years of age, but care beyond this
age was not studied for this guideline.
Since 2011, much research has
occurred, and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition (DSM-5), has been
released. The new research and DSM-
5 do not, however, support dramatic
changes to the previous
recommendations. Hence, this new
guideline includes only incremental
updates to the previous guideline.
One such update is the addition of
a key action statement (KAS) about
the diagnosis and treatment of
coexisting or comorbid conditions in
children and adolescents with ADHD.
The subcommittee uses the term
“comorbid,” to be consistent with the
DSM-5.
Since 2011, the release of new
research reﬂects an increased
understanding and recognition of
ADHD’s prevalence and
epidemiology; the challenges it raises
for children and families; the need for
a comprehensive clinical resource for
the evaluation, diagnosis, and
treatment of pediatric ADHD; and the
barriers that impede the
implementation of such a resource. In
response, this guideline is supported
by 2 accompanying documents,
available in the Supplemental
Information: (1) a process of care
algorithm (PoCA) for the diagnosis
and treatment of children and
adolescents with ADHD and (2) an
article on systemic barriers to the
care of children and adolescents with
ADHD. These supplemental
documents are designed to aid PCCs
in implementing the formal
recommendations for the evaluation,
diagnosis, and treatment of children
and adolescents with ADHD. Although
this document is speciﬁc to children
and adolescents in the United States
in some of its recommendations,
international stakeholders can modify
speciﬁc content (ie, educational laws
about accommodations, etc) as
needed. (Prevention is addressed in
the Mental Health Task Force
recommendations.2)
PoCA for the Diagnosis and
Treatment of Children and
Adolescents With ADHD
In this revised guideline and
accompanying PoCA, we recognize
that evaluation, diagnosis, and
treatment are a continuous process.
The PoCA provides recommendations
for implementing the guideline steps,
although there is less evidence for the
PoCA than for the guidelines. The
section on evaluating and treating
comorbidities has also been expanded
in the PoCA document.
Systems Barriers to the Care of
Children and Adolescents With ADHD
There are many system-level barriers
that hamper the adoption of the best-
practice recommendations contained
in the clinical practice guideline and
the PoCA. The procedures
recommended in this guideline
necessitate spending more time with
patients and their families,
developing a care management
system of contacts with school and
other community stakeholders, and
providing continuous, coordinated
care to the patient and his or her
family. There is some evidence that
African American and Latino children
are less likely to have ADHD
diagnosed and are less likely to be
treated for ADHD. Special attention
should be given to these populations
when assessing comorbidities as they
relate to ADHD and when treating for
ADHD symptoms.3 Given the
nationwide problem of limited access
to mental health clinicians,4
pediatricians and other PCCs are
increasingly called on to provide
services to patients with ADHD and to
their families. In addition, the AAP
holds that primary care pediatricians
should be prepared to diagnose and
manage mild-to-moderate ADHD,
anxiety, depression, and problematic
substance use, as well as co-manage
patients who have more severe
conditions with mental health
professionals. Unfortunately, third-
party payers seldom pay
appropriately for these time-
consuming services.5,6
To assist pediatricians and other
PCCs in overcoming such obstacles,
the companion article on systemic
barriers to the care of children and
adolescents with ADHD reviews the
barriers and makes recommendations
to address them to enhance care for
children and adolescents with ADHD.
ADHD EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SCOPE
Prevalence estimates of ADHD vary
on the basis of differences in research
methodologies, the various age
groups being described, and changes
in diagnostic criteria over time.7
Authors of a recent meta-analysis
calculated a pooled worldwide ADHD
prevalence of 7.2% among children8;
estimates from some community-
based samples are somewhat higher,
at 8.7% to 15.5%.9,10 National survey
data from 2016 indicate that 9.4% of
children in the United States 2 to
17 years of age have ever had an
ADHD diagnosis, including 2.4% of
children 2 to 5 years of age.11 In that

Downloaded from 
national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to
17 years of age currently had ADHD,
representing 5.4 million children.11
Among children and adolescents with
current ADHD, almost two-thirds
were taking medication, and
approximately half had received
behavioral treatment of ADHD in the
past year. Nearly one quarter had
received neither type of treatment of
ADHD.11
Symptoms of ADHD occur in
childhood, and most children with
ADHD will continue to have
symptoms and impairment through
adolescence and into adulthood.
According to a 2014 national survey,
the median age of diagnosis was
7 years; approximately one-third of
children were diagnosed before
6 years of age.12 More than half of
these children were ﬁrst diagnosed
by a PCC, often a pediatrician.12 As
individuals with ADHD enter
adolescence, their overt hyperactive
and impulsive symptoms tend to
decline, whereas their inattentive
symptoms tend to persist.13,14
Learning and language problems are
common comorbid conditions with
ADHD.15
Boys are more than twice as likely as
girls to receive a diagnosis of
ADHD,9,11,16 possibly because
hyperactive behaviors, which are
easily observable and potentially
disruptive, are seen more frequently
in boys. The majority of both boys
and girls with ADHD also meet
diagnostic criteria for another mental
disorder.17,18 Boys are more likely to
exhibit externalizing conditions like
oppositional deﬁant disorder or
conduct disorder.17,19,20 Recent
research has established that girls
with ADHD are more likely than boys
to have a comorbid internalizing
condition like anxiety or
depression.21
Although there is a greater risk of
receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for
children who are the youngest in
their class (who are therefore less
developmentally capable of
compensating for their weaknesses),
for most children, retention is not
beneﬁcial.22
METHODOLOGY
As with the original 2000 clinical
practice guideline and the 2011
revision, the AAP collaborated with
several organizations to form
a subcommittee on ADHD (the
subcommittee) under the oversight of
the AAP Council on Quality
Improvement and Patient Safety.
The subcommittee’s membership
included representation of a wide
range of primary care and
subspecialty groups, including
primary care pediatricians,
developmental-behavioral
pediatricians, an epidemiologist from
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; and representatives from
the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry, the Society for
Pediatric Psychology, the National
Association of School Psychologists,
the Society for Developmental and
Behavioral Pediatrics (SDBP), the
American Academy of Family
Physicians, and Children and Adults
with Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder (CHADD) to provide
feedback on the patient/parent
perspective.
This subcommittee met over a 3.5-
year period from 2015 to 2018 to
review practice changes and newly
identiﬁed issues that have arisen
since the publication of the 2011
guidelines. The subcommittee
members’ potential conﬂicts were
identiﬁed and taken into
consideration in the group’s
deliberations. No conﬂicts prevented
subcommittee member participation
on the guidelines.
Research Questions
The subcommittee developed a series
of research questions to direct an
evidence-based review sponsored by
1 of the Evidence-based Practice
Centers of the US Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ).23 These questions assessed
4 diagnostic areas and 3 treatment
areas on the basis of research
published in 2011 through 2016.
The AHRQ’s framework was guided
by key clinical questions addressing
diagnosis as well as treatment
interventions for children and
adolescents 4 to 18 years of age.
The ﬁrst clinical questions pertaining
to ADHD diagnosis were as follows:
1. What is the comparative
diagnostic accuracy of approaches
that can be used in the primary
care practice setting or by
specialists to diagnose ADHD
among children younger than
7 years of age?
2. What is the comparative
diagnostic accuracy of EEG,
imaging, or executive function
approaches that can be used in the
primary care practice setting or by
specialists to diagnose ADHD
among individuals aged 7 to their
18th birthday?
3. What are the adverse effects
associated with being labeled
correctly or incorrectly as having
ADHD?
4. Are there more formal
neuropsychological, imaging, or
genetic tests that improve the
diagnostic process?
The treatment questions were as
follows:
1. What are the comparative safety
and effectiveness of pharmacologic
and/or nonpharmacologic
treatments of ADHD in improving
outcomes associated with ADHD?
2. What is the risk of diversion of
pharmacologic treatment?
3. What are the comparative safety
and effectiveness of different
monitoring strategies to evaluate
the effectiveness of treatment or
changes in ADHD status (eg,
worsening or resolving
symptoms)?

Downloaded from 
In addition to this review of the
research questions, the subcommittee
considered information from a review
of evidence-based psychosocial
treatments for children and
adolescents with ADHD24 (which, in
some cases, affected the evidence
grade) as well as updated information
on prevalence from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Evidence Review
This article followed the latest
version of the evidence base update
format used to develop the previous 3
clinical practice guidelines.24–26
Under this format, studies were only
included in the review when they met
a variety of criteria designed to
ensure the research was based on
a strong methodology that yielded
conﬁdence in its conclusions.
The level of efﬁcacy for each
treatment was deﬁned on the basis of
child-focused outcomes related to
both symptoms and impairment.
Hence, improvements in behaviors on
the part of parents or teachers, such
as the use of communication or
praise, were not considered in the
review. Although these outcomes are
important, they address how
treatment reaches the child or
adolescent with ADHD and are,
therefore, secondary to changes in the
child’s behavior. Focusing on
improvements in the child or
adolescent’s symptoms and
impairment emphasizes the
disorder’s characteristics and
manifestations that affect children
and their families.
The treatment-related evidence relied
on a recent review of literature from
2011 through 2016 by the AHRQ of
citations from Medline, Embase,
PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database
of Systematic Reviews.
The original methodology and report,
including the evidence search and
review, are available in their entirety
and as an executive summary at
https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/
sites/default/ﬁles/pdf/cer-203-adhd-
ﬁnal_0.pdf.
The evidence is discussed in more
detail in published reports and
articles.25
Guideline Recommendations and Key
Action Statements
The AAP policy statement,
“Classifying Recommendations for
Clinical Practice Guidelines,” was
followed in designating aggregate
evidence quality levels for the
available evidence (see Fig 1).27 The
AAP policy statement is consistent
with the grading recommendations
advanced by the University of
Oxford Centre for Evidence Based
Medicine.
The subcommittee reached consensus
on the evidence, which was then used
to develop the clinical practice
guideline’s KASs.
When the scientiﬁc evidence was at
least “good” in quality and
demonstrated a preponderance of
beneﬁts over harms, the KAS provides
a “strong recommendation” or
“recommendation.”27 Clinicians
should follow a “strong
recommendation” unless a clear and
compelling rationale for an
alternative approach is present;
clinicians are prudent to follow
a “recommendation” but are advised
to remain alert to new information
and be sensitive to patient
preferences27 (see Fig 1).
When the scientiﬁc evidence
comprised lower-quality or limited
data and expert consensus or high-
quality evidence with a balance
between beneﬁts and harms, the KAS
provides an “option” level of
recommendation. Options are clinical
interventions that a reasonable
health care provider might or might
not wish to implement in the
practice.27 Where the evidence
was lacking, a combination of
evidence and expert consensus

would be used, although this
did not occur in these
guidelines, and all KASs
achieved a “strong
recommendation” level except
for KAS 7, on comorbidities,
which received a recommendation
level (see Fig 1).
As shown in Fig 1, integrating
evidence quality appraisal with an
assessment of the anticipated balance
between beneﬁts and harms leads to
a designation of a strong
recommendation, recommendation,
option, or no recommendation.
Once the evidence level was
determined, an evidence grade was
assigned. AAP policy stipulates that
the evidence supporting each KAS be
prospectively identiﬁed, appraised,
and summarized, and an explicit link
between quality levels and the grade
of recommendation must be deﬁned.
Possible grades of recommendations
range from “A” to “D,” with “A” being
the highest:
• grade A: consistent level A studies;
• grade B: consistent level B or
extrapolations from level A studies;
• grade C: level C studies or
extrapolations from level B or level
C studies;
• grade D: level D evidence or
troublingly inconsistent or
inconclusive studies of any level;
and
• level X: not an explicit level of
evidence as outlined by the Centre
for Evidence-Based Medicine. This
level is reserved for interventions
that are unethical or impossible to
test in a controlled or scientiﬁc
fashion and for which the
preponderance of beneﬁt or harm
is overwhelming, precluding
rigorous investigation.
Guided by the evidence quality and
grade, the subcommittee developed 7
KASs for the evaluation, diagnosis,
and treatment of ADHD in children
and adolescents (see Table 1).
These KASs provide for consistent
and high-quality care for children and
adolescents who may have symptoms
suggesting attention disorders or
problems as well as for their families.
In developing the 7 KASs, the
subcommittee considered the
requirements for establishing the
diagnosis; the prevalence of ADHD;
the effect of untreated ADHD; the
efﬁcacy and adverse effects of
treatment; various long-term
outcomes; the importance of
coordination between pediatric and
mental health service providers; the
value of the medical home; and the
common occurrence of comorbid
conditions, the importance of
addressing them, and the effects of
not treating them.
The subcommittee members with the
most epidemiological experience
assessed the strength of each
recommendation and the quality of
evidence supporting each draft KAS.
Peer Review
The guidelines and PoCA underwent
extensive peer review by more than
30 internal stakeholders (eg, AAP
committees, sections, councils, and
task forces) and external stakeholder
groups identiﬁed by the
subcommittee. The resulting
comments were compiled and
reviewed by the chair and vice chair;
relevant changes were incorporated
into the draft, which was then
reviewed by the full subcommittee.
KASS FOR THE EVALUATION,
DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND
MONITORING OF CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS WITH ADHD
KAS 1
The pediatrician or other PCC should
initiate an evaluation for ADHD for
any child or adolescent age 4 years to
the 18th birthday who presents with
academic or behavioral problems and
symptoms of inattention,
hyperactivity, or impulsivity
(Table 2). (Grade B: strong
recommendation.)
The basis for this recommendation is
essentially unchanged from the
previous guideline. As noted, ADHD is
the most common neurobehavioral
disorder of childhood, occurring in
approximately 7% to 8% of children
and youth.8,18,28,29 Hence, the number
of children with this condition is far
greater than can be managed by the
mental health system.4 There is
evidence that appropriate diagnosis
can be accomplished in the primary
care setting for children and
adolescents.30,31 Note that there is
insufﬁcient evidence to recommend
diagnosis or treatment for children
younger than 4 years (other than
parent training in behavior
management [PTBM], which does not
require a diagnosis to be applied); in
instances in which ADHD-like
symptoms in children younger than
4 years bring substantial impairment,
PCCs can consider making a referral
for PTBM.
KAS 2
To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the
PCC should determine that DSM-5
criteria have been met, including
documentation of symptoms and
impairment in more than 1 major
setting (ie, social, academic, or
occupational), with information
obtained primarily from reports from
parents or guardians, teachers, other
school personnel, and mental health
clinicians who are involved in the
child or adolescent’s care. The PCC
should also rule out any alternative
cause (Table 3). (Grade B: strong
recommendation.)
The American Psychiatric Association
developed the DSM-5 using expert
consensus and an expanding research
foundation.32 The DSM-5 system is
used by professionals in psychiatry,
psychology, health care systems, and
primary care; it is also well
established with third-party payers.

The DSM-5 criteria deﬁne 4
dimensions of ADHD:
1. attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder primarily of the
inattentive presentation (ADHD/I)
(314.00 [F90.0]);
2. attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder primarily of the
hyperactive-impulsive
presentation (ADHD/HI) (314.01
[F90.1]);
3. attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder combined presentation
(ADHD/C) (314.01 [F90.2]); and
4. ADHD other speciﬁed and
unspeciﬁed ADHD (314.01
[F90.8]).
As with the previous guideline
recommendations, the DSM-5
classiﬁcation criteria are based on
the best available evidence for
ADHD diagnosis and are the
standard most frequently used by
clinicians and researchers to render
the diagnosis and document its
appropriateness for a given child.
The use of neuropsychological
testing has not been found to
improve diagnostic accuracy in
most cases, although it may have
beneﬁt in clarifying the child
or adolescent’s learning
strengths and weaknesses. (See the
TABLE 1 Summary of KASs for Diagnosing, Evaluating, and Treating ADHD in Children and Adolescents
KASs
Evidence Quality, Strength of Recommendation
KAS 1: The pediatrician or other PCC should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child or
adolescent age 4 years to the 18th birthday who presents with academic or behavioral
problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.
Grade B, strong recommendation
KAS 2: To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the PCC should determine that DSM-5 criteria have been
met, including documentation of symptoms and impairment in more than 1 major setting
(ie, social, academic, or occupational), with information obtained primarily from reports
from parents or guardians, teachers, other school personnel, and mental health
clinicians who are involved in the child or adolescent’s care. The PCC should also rule out
any alternative cause.
Grade B, strong recommendation
KAS 3: In the evaluation of a child or adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should include a process
to at least screen for comorbid conditions, including emotional or behavioral conditions
(eg, anxiety, depression, oppositional deﬁant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use),
developmental conditions (eg, learning and language disorders, autism spectrum
disorders), and physical conditions (eg, tics, sleep apnea).
Grade B, strong recommendation
KAS 4: ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and
adolescents with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with
special health care needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the
medical home.
Grade B, strong recommendation
KAS 5a: For preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD, the PCC
should prescribe evidence-based PTBM and/or behavioral classroom interventions as the
ﬁrst line of treatment, if available.
Grade A, strong recommendation for PTBM
Methylphenidate may be considered if these behavioral interventions do not provide
signiﬁcant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the
4- through 5-year-old child’s functioning. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral
treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting
medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment.
Grade B, strong recommendation for methylphenidate
KAS 5b. For elementary and middle school-aged children (age 6 years to the 12th birthday)
with ADHD, the PCC should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD, along with
PTBM and/or behavioral classroom intervention (preferably both PTBM and behavioral
classroom interventions). Educational interventions and individualized instructional
supports, including school environment, class placement, instructional placement, and
behavioral supports, are a necessary part of any treatment plan and often include an IEP
or a rehabilitation plan (504 plan).
Grade A, strong recommendation for medications
Grade A, strong recommendation for training and behavioral
treatments for ADHD with family and school
KAS 5c. For adolescents (age 12 years to the 18th birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should
prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD with the adolescent’s assent. The PCC is
encouraged to prescribe evidence-based training interventions and/or behavioral
interventions as treatment of ADHD, if available. Educational interventions and
individualized instructional supports, including school environment, class placement,
instructional placement, and behavioral supports, are a necessary part of any treatment
plan and often include an IEP or a rehabilitation plan (504 plan).
Grade A, strong recommendation for medications
Grade A, strong recommendation for training and behavioral
treatments for ADHD with the family and school
KAS 6. The PCC should titrate doses of medication for ADHD to achieve maximum beneﬁt with
tolerable side effects.
Grade B, strong recommendation
KAS 7. The PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate
treatment of such conditions or make a referral to an appropriate subspecialist for
treatment. After detecting possible comorbid conditions, if the PCC is not trained or
experienced in making the diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be
referred to an appropriate subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment.

Special Circumstances: Preschool-Aged
Children (Age 4 Years to the Sixth
Birthday)
There is evidence that the diagnostic
criteria for ADHD can be applied to
preschool-aged children.33–39 A
review of the literature, including the
multisite study of the efﬁcacy of
methylphenidate in preschool-aged
children, found that the DSM-5
criteria could appropriately identify
children with ADHD.25
To make a diagnosis of ADHD in
preschool-aged children, clinicians
should conduct a clinical interview
with parents, examine and observe
the child, and obtain information
from parents and teachers through
DSM-based ADHD rating scales.40
Normative data are available for the
DSM-5–based rating scales for ages
5 years to the 18th birthday.41 There
are, however, minimal changes in the
speciﬁc behaviors from the DSM-IV,
on which all the other DSM-based
ADHD rating scales obtained
normative data. Both the ADHD
Rating Scale-IV and the Conners
Rating Scale have preschool-age
normative data based on the DSM-IV.
The speciﬁc behaviors in the DSM-5
criteria for ADHD are the same for all
children younger than 18 years (ie,
preschool-aged children, elementary
and middle school–aged children, and
adolescents) and are only minimally
different from the DSM-IV. Hence, if
clinicians do not have the ADHD
Rating Scale-5 or the ADHD Rating
Scale-IV Preschool Version,42 any
other DSM-based scale can be used to
provide a systematic method for
collecting information from parents
and teachers, even in the absence of
normative data.
Pediatricians and other PCCs should
be aware that determining the
presence of key symptoms in this age
group has its challenges, such as
TABLE 2 KAS 1: The pediatrician or other PCC should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child or adolescent age 4 years to the 18th birthday who
presents with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. (Grade B: strong recommendation.)
Aggregate evidence
quality
Grade B
Beneﬁts
ADHD goes undiagnosed in a considerable number of children and adolescents. Primary care clinicians’ more-rigorous identiﬁcation
of children with these problems is likely to decrease the rate of undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in children and adolescents.
Risks, harm, cost
Children and adolescents in whom ADHD is inappropriately diagnosed may be labeled inappropriately, or another condition may be
missed, and they may receive treatments that will not beneﬁt them.
Beneﬁt-harm
assessment
The high prevalence of ADHD and limited mental health resources require primary care pediatricians and other PCCs to play
a signiﬁcant role in the care of patients with ADHD and assist them to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Treatments
available have good evidence of efﬁcacy, and a lack of treatment has the risk of impaired outcomes.
Intentional vagueness
There are limits between what a PCC can address and what should be referred to a subspecialist because of varying degrees of skills
and comfort levels present among the former.
Role of patient
preferences
Success with treatment is dependent on patient and family preference, which need to be taken into account.
Exclusions
None.
Strength
Strong recommendation.

Beneﬁts
Use of the DSM-5 criteria has led to more uniform categorization of the condition across professional disciplines. The criteria are
essentially unchanged from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), for children up to
their 18th birthday, except that DSM-IV required onset prior to age 7 for a diagnosis, while DSM-5 requires onset prior to age 12.
Risks, harm, cost
The DSM-5 does not speciﬁcally state that symptoms must be beyond expected levels for developmental (rather than chronologic) age
to qualify for an ADHD diagnosis, which may lead to some misdiagnoses in children with developmental disorders.

The beneﬁts far outweigh the harm.

observing symptoms across multiple
settings as required by the DSM-5,
particularly among children who do
not attend a preschool or child care
program. Here, too, focused checklists
can be used to aid in the diagnostic
evaluation.
PTBM is the recommended primary
intervention for preschool-aged
children with ADHD as well as
children with ADHD-like behaviors
whose diagnosis is not yet veriﬁed.
This type of training helps parents
learn age-appropriate developmental
expectations, behaviors that
strengthen the parent-child
relationship, and speciﬁc
management skills for problem
behaviors. Clinicians do not need to
have made an ADHD diagnosis before
recommending PTBM because PTBM
has documented effectiveness with
a wide variety of problem behaviors,
regardless of etiology. In addition, the
intervention’s results may inform the
subsequent diagnostic evaluation.
Clinicians are encouraged to
recommend that parents complete
PTBM, if available, before assigning
an ADHD diagnosis.
After behavioral parent training is
implemented, the clinician can
obtain information from parents and
teachers through DSM-5–based
ADHD rating scales. The clinician
may obtain reports about the
parents’ ability to manage their
children and about the child’s core
symptoms and impairments.
Referral to an early intervention
program or enrolling in a PTBM
program can help provide
information about the child’s
behavior in other settings or with
other observers. The evaluators for
these programs and/or early
childhood special education teachers
may be useful observers, as well.
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
(Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday)
Obtaining teacher reports for
adolescents is often more challenging
than for younger children because
many adolescents have multiple
teachers. Likewise, an adolescent’s
parents may have less opportunity to
observe their child’s behaviors than
they did when the child was younger.
Furthermore, some problems
experienced by children with ADHD
are less obvious in adolescents than
in younger children because
adolescents are less likely to exhibit
overt hyperactive behavior. Of note,
adolescents’ reports of their own
behaviors often differ from other
observers because they tend to
minimize their own problematic
behaviors.43–45
Despite these difﬁculties, clinicians
need to try to obtain information
from at least 2 teachers or other
sources, such as coaches, school
guidance counselors, or leaders of
community activities in which the
adolescent participates.46 For the
evaluation to be successful, it is
essential that adolescents agree with
and participate in the evaluation.
Variability in ratings is to be
expected because adolescents’
behavior often varies between
different classrooms and with
different teachers. Identifying
reasons for any variability can
provide valuable clinical insight into
the adolescent’s problems.
Note that, unless they previously
received a diagnosis, to meet DSM-5
criteria for ADHD, adolescents must
have some reported or documented
manifestations of inattention or
hyperactivity/impulsivity before age
12. Therefore, clinicians must
establish that an adolescent had
manifestations of ADHD before age
12 and strongly consider whether
a mimicking or comorbid condition,
such as substance use, depression,
and/or anxiety, is present.46
In addition, the risks of mood and
anxiety disorders and risky sexual
behaviors increase during
adolescence, as do the risks of
intentional self-harm and suicidal
behaviors.31 Clinicians should also
be aware that adolescents are at
greater risk for substance use than
are younger children.44,45,47 Certain
substances, such as marijuana, can
have effects that mimic ADHD;
adolescent patients may also attempt
to obtain stimulant medication to
enhance performance (ie, academic,
athletic, etc) by feigning symptoms.48
Trauma experiences, posttraumatic
stress disorder, and toxic stress are
additional comorbidities and risk
factors of concern.
Special Circumstances: Inattention or
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem
Level)
Teachers, parents, and child health
professionals typically encounter
children who demonstrate behaviors
relating to activity level, impulsivity,
and inattention but who do not fully
meet DSM-5 criteria. When assessing
these children, diagnostic criteria
should be closely reviewed, which
may require obtaining more
information from other settings and
sources. Also consider that these
symptoms may suggest other
problems that mimic ADHD.
Behavioral interventions, such
as PTBM, are often beneﬁcial for
children with hyperactive/impulsive
behaviors who do not meet full
diagnostic criteria for ADHD.
As noted previously, these programs
do not require a speciﬁc diagnosis
to be beneﬁcial to the family. The
previous guideline discussed
the diagnosis of problem-level
concerns on the basis of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for
Primary Care (DSM-PC), Child and
Adolescent Version,49 and made
suggestions for treatment and care.
The DSM-PC was published in 1995,
however, and it has not been revised
to be compatible with the DSM-5.
Therefore, the DSM-PC cannot be
used as a deﬁnitive source for
diagnostic codes related to ADHD and
comorbid conditions, although it can
be used conceptually as a resource for

KAS 3
In the evaluation of a child or
adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should
include a process to at least screen
for comorbid conditions, including
emotional or behavioral conditions
(eg, anxiety, depression, oppositional
deﬁant disorder, conduct disorders,
substance use), developmental
conditions (eg, learning and language
disorders, autism spectrum
disorders), and physical conditions
(eg, tics, sleep apnea) (Table 4).
(Grade B: strong recommendation.)
The majority of both boys and girls
with ADHD also meet diagnostic
criteria for another mental
disorder.17,18 A variety of other
behavioral, developmental, and
physical conditions can be comorbid
in children and adolescents who are
evaluated for ADHD, including
emotional or behavioral conditions or
a history of these problems. These
include but are not limited to learning
disabilities, language disorder,
disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood
disorders, tic disorders, seizures,
autism spectrum disorder,
developmental coordination disorder,
and sleep disorders.50–66 In some
cases, the presence of a comorbid
condition will alter the treatment
of ADHD.
The SDBP is developing a clinical
practice guideline to support
clinicians in the diagnosis of
treatment of “complex ADHD,” which
includes ADHD with comorbid
developmental and/or mental health
conditions.67
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
(Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday)
At a minimum, clinicians should
assess adolescent patients with newly
diagnosed ADHD for symptoms and
signs of substance use, anxiety,
depression, and learning disabilities.
As noted, all 4 are common comorbid
conditions that affect the treatment
approach. These comorbidities make
it important for the clinician to
consider sequencing psychosocial and
medication treatments to maximize
the impact on areas of greatest risk
and impairment while monitoring for
possible risks such as stimulant abuse
or suicidal ideation.

ADHD is a chronic condition;
therefore, the PCC should manage
children and adolescents with ADHD
in the same manner that they would
children and youth with special
health care needs, following the
principles of the chronic care model
and the medical home (Table 5).
(Grade B: strong recommendation.)
As in the 2 previous guidelines, this
recommendation is based on the
evidence that for many individuals,
ADHD causes symptoms and
dysfunction over long periods of time,
even into adulthood. Available
treatments address symptoms and
function but are usually not curative.
Although the chronic illness model
has not been speciﬁcally studied in
children and adolescents with ADHD,
it has been effective for other chronic
conditions, such as asthma.68 In
addition, the medical home model has
been accepted as the preferred
standard of care for children with
chronic conditions.69
The medical home and chronic illness
approach may be particularly
beneﬁcial for parents who also have
ADHD themselves. These parents can
beneﬁt from extra support to help
them follow a consistent schedule for
medication and behavioral programs.
Authors of longitudinal studies have
found that ADHD treatments are
frequently not maintained over
time13 and impairments persist into
adulthood.70 It is indicated in
prospective studies that patients with
ADHD, whether treated or not, are at
increased risk for early death, suicide,
and increased psychiatric
TABLE 4 KAS 3: In the evaluation of a child or adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should include a process to at least screen for comorbid conditions, including
emotional or behavioral conditions (eg, anxiety, depression, oppositional deﬁant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use), developmental

involved in the child or adolescent’s
care. This communication can be
difﬁcult to achieve and is discussed in
both the PoCA and the section on
systemic barriers to the care of
children and adolescents with ADHD
in the Supplemental Information, as is
the medical home model.69

Recommendations for the Treatment
of Children and Adolescents With
ADHD: KAS 5a, 5b, and 5c
Recommendations vary depending on
the patient’s age and are presented
for the following age ranges:
a. preschool-aged children: age
4 years to the sixth birthday;
b. elementary and middle
school–aged children: age 6 years
to the 12th birthday; and
c. adolescents: age 12 years to the
18th birthday.
The KASs are presented, followed by
information on medication,
psychosocial treatments, and special
circumstances.
KAS 5a
For preschool-aged children (age
4 years to the sixth birthday) with
ADHD, the PCC should prescribe
evidence-based behavioral PTBM
and/or behavioral classroom
interventions as the ﬁrst line of
treatment, if available (grade A:
strong recommendation).
Methylphenidate may be considered
if these behavioral interventions do
not provide signiﬁcant improvement
and there is moderate-to-severe
continued disturbance in the 4-
through 5-year-old child’s
functioning. In areas in which
evidence-based behavioral
treatments are not available, the
clinician needs to weigh the risks of
starting medication before the age of
6 years against the harm of delaying
treatment (Table 6). (Grade B: strong
recommendation.)
A number of special circumstances
support the recommendation to
initiate PTBM as the ﬁrst treatment
of preschool-aged children (age
4 years to the sixth birthday) with
ADHD.25,83 Although it was limited to
children who had moderate-to-
severe dysfunction, the largest
multisite study of methylphenidate
use in preschool-aged children
revealed symptom improvements
after PTBM alone.83 The overall
evidence for PTBM among
preschoolers is strong.
PTBM programs for preschool-aged
children are typically group programs
and, although they are not always
paid for by health insurance, they
may be relatively low cost. One
evidence-based PTBM, parent-child
interaction therapy, is a dyadic
therapy for parent and child. The
PoCA contains criteria for the
clinician’s use to assess the quality of
PTBM programs. If the child attends
preschool, behavioral classroom
interventions are also recommended.
In addition, preschool programs (such
as Head Start) and ADHD-focused
organizations (such as CHADD84) can
also provide behavioral supports. The
issues related to referral, payment,
and communication are discussed in
the section on systemic barriers in
the Supplemental Information.

In areas in which evidence-based
behavioral treatments are not
available, the clinician needs to
weigh the risks of starting
methylphenidate before the age
of 6 years against the harm of
delaying diagnosis and treatment.
Other stimulant or nonstimulant
medications have not been
adequately studied in children in
this age group with ADHD.
KAS 5b
For elementary and middle
school–aged children (age 6 years to
the 12th birthday) with ADHD, the
PCC should prescribe US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)–approved
medications for ADHD, along with
PTBM and/or behavioral classroom
intervention (preferably both PTBM
and behavioral classroom interven-
tions). Educational interventions
and individualized instructional
supports, including school environment,
class placement, instructional
placement, and behavioral supports,
are a necessary part of any
treatment plan and often include an
Individualized Education Program
(IEP) or a rehabilitation plan (504
plan) (Table 7). (Grade A: strong
recommendation for medications;
grade A: strong recommendation for
PTBM training and behavioral
treatments for ADHD implemented
with the family and school.)
The evidence is particularly strong for
stimulant medications; it is sufﬁcient,
but not as strong, for atomoxetine,
extended-release guanfacine, and
extended-release clonidine, in that
order (see the Treatment section, and
see the PoCA for more information on
implementation).
KAS 5c
For adolescents (age 12 years to the
18th birthday) with ADHD, the PCC
should prescribe FDA-approved
medications for ADHD with the
adolescent’s assent (grade A: strong
recommendation). The PCC is
encouraged to prescribe evidence-
based training interventions and/or
behavioral interventions as treatment
of ADHD, if available. Educational
interventions and individualized
instructional supports, including
school environment, class
placement, instructional placement,
and behavioral supports, are
a necessary part of any treatment
plan and often include an IEP or
a rehabilitation plan (504 plan)
(Table 8). (Grade A: strong
recommendation.)
Transition to adult care is an
important component of the chronic
care model for ADHD. Planning for
the transition to adult care is an
ongoing process that may culminate
after high school or, perhaps, after
college. To foster a smooth transition,
it is best to introduce components at
the start of high school, at about
14 years of age, and speciﬁcally focus
during the 2 years preceding high
school completion.
Psychosocial Treatments
Some psychosocial treatments for
children and adolescents with ADHD
have been demonstrated to be
effective for the treatment of ADHD,
including behavioral therapy and
training interventions.24–26,85 The
diversity of interventions and
outcome measures makes it
challenging to assess a meta-analysis
of psychosocial treatment’s effects
alone or in association with
medication treatment. As with
medication treatment, the long-term
positive effects of psychosocial
treatments have yet to be determined.
Nonetheless, ongoing adherence
to psychosocial treatment is
a key contributor to its beneﬁcial
effects, making implementation of
a chronic care model for child health
important to ensure sustained
adherence.86
Behavioral therapy involves training
adults to inﬂuence the contingencies
in an environment to improve the
behavior of a child or adolescent in
that setting. It can help parents and
school personnel learn how to
effectively prevent and respond to
adolescent behaviors such as
TABLE 6 KAS 5a: For preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should prescribe evidence-based behavioral PTBM

Risks, harm, cost
Both therapies increase the cost of care; PTBM requires a high level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some
potential adverse effects.

interrupting, aggression, not
completing tasks, and not complying
with requests. Behavioral parent and
classroom training are well-
established treatments with
preadolescent children.25,87,88 Most
studies comparing behavior therapy
to stimulants indicate that stimulants
have a stronger immediate effect on
the 18 core symptoms of ADHD.
Parents, however, were more satisﬁed
with the effect of behavioral therapy,
which addresses symptoms and
functions in addition to ADHD’s core
symptoms. The positive effects of
behavioral therapies tend to persist,
but the positive effects of medication
cease when medication stops.
Optimal care is likely to occur when
both therapies are used, but the
decision about therapies is heavily
dependent on acceptability by, and
feasibility for, the family.
Training interventions target skill
development and involve repeated
practice with performance feedback
over time, rather than modifying
behavioral contingencies in a speciﬁc
setting. Less research has been
conducted on training interventions
compared to behavioral treatments;
nonetheless, training interventions
are well-established treatments to
target disorganization of materials
and time that are exhibited by
most youth with ADHD; it is likely
that they will beneﬁt younger
children, as well.25,89 Some training
interventions, including social
skills training, have not been shown
to be effective for children with
ADHD.25

Some nonmedication treatments for
ADHD-related problems have either
too little evidence to recommend them
or have been found to have little or no
beneﬁt. These include mindfulness,
cognitive training, diet modiﬁcation,
EEG biofeedback, and supportive
counseling. The suggestion that
cannabidiol oil has any effect on ADHD
is anecdotal and has not been
subjected to rigorous study. Although
it is FDA approved, the efﬁcacy for
external trigeminal nerve stimulation
(eTNS) is documented by one 5-week
randomized controlled trial with just
30 participants receiving eTNS.90 To
date, there is no long-term safety and
efﬁcacy evidence for eTNS. Overall, the
current evidence supporting
treatment of ADHD with eTNS is
sparse and in no way approaches the
robust strength of evidence
documented for established
medication and behavioral treatments
for ADHD; therefore, it cannot be
recommended as a treatment of ADHD
without considerably more extensive
study on its efﬁcacy and safety.
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
Much less research has been
published on psychosocial treatments
with adolescents than with younger
children. PTBM has been modiﬁed to
include the parents and adolescents
in sessions together to develop
a behavioral contract and improve
parent-adolescent communication
and problem-solving (see above).91
Some training programs also include
motivational interviewing
approaches. The evidence for this
behavioral family approach is mixed
and less strong than PTBM with pre-
adolescent children.92–94 Adolescents’
responses to behavioral contingencies
are more varied than those of
younger children because they can
often effectively obstruct behavioral
contracts, increasing parent-
adolescent conﬂict.
Training approaches that are focused
on school functioning skills have
consistently revealed beneﬁts for
adolescents.95–97 The greatest
beneﬁts from training interventions
occur when treatment is continued
over an extended period of time,
performance feedback is constructive
and frequent, and the target
behaviors are directly applicable to
the adolescent’s daily functioning.
Overall, behavioral family approaches
may be helpful to some adolescents
and their families, and school-based
training interventions are well
established.25,94 Meaningful
improvements in functioning have
not been reported from cognitive
behavioral approaches.
Medication for ADHD
Preschool-aged children may
experience increased mood lability
and dysphoria with stimulant
medications.83 None of the
nonstimulants have FDA approval for
use in preschool-aged children. For
elementary school–aged students, the
evidence is particularly strong for
stimulant medications and is
sufﬁcient, but less strong, for
atomoxetine, extended-release
guanfacine, and extended-release
clonidine (in that order). The effect
size for stimulants is 1.0 and for
nonstimulants is 0.7. An individual’s
response to methylphenidate verses
amphetamine is idiosyncratic, with
approximately 40% responding to
both and about 40% responding to
only 1. The subtype of ADHD does not
appear to be a predictor of response
to a speciﬁc agent. For most
adolescents, stimulant medications
are highly effective in reducing
ADHD’s core symptoms.73
Stimulant medications have an effect
size of around 1.0 (effect size =
[treatment M 2 control M)/control
SD]) for the treatment of ADHD.98
Among nonstimulant medications, 1
selective norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, atomoxetine,99,100 and 2
selective a-2 adrenergic agonists,
extended-release guanfacine101,102
and extended-release clonidine,103
have also demonstrated efﬁcacy in
reducing core symptoms among
school-aged children and adolescents,
although their effect sizes, —around
0.7 for all 3, are less robust than that
of stimulant medications.
Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
and a-2 adrenergic agonists are
newer medications, so, in general, the
evidence base supporting them is
considerably less than that for
stimulants, although it was adequate
for FDA approval.
A free list of the currently available,
FDA-approved medications for ADHD
is available online at www.
ADHDMedicationGuide.com. Each
medication’s characteristics are
provided to help guide the clinician’s
prescription choice. With the
expanded list of medications, it is less
likely that PCCs need to consider the
off-label use of other medications.
The section on systemic barriers in
the Supplemental Information
provides suggestions for fostering
more realistic and effective payment
and communication systems.
Because of the large variability in
patients’ response to ADHD
medication, there is great interest in
pharmacogenetic tools that can help
clinicians predict the best medication
and dose for each child or adolescent.
At this time, however, the available
scientiﬁc literature does not provide
sufﬁcient evidence to support their
clinical utility given that the genetic
variants assayed by these tools have
generally not been fully studied with
respect to medication effects on
ADHD-related symptoms and/or
impairment, study ﬁndings are
inconsistent, or effect sizes are not of
sufﬁcient size to ensure clinical
utility.104–109 For that reason, these
pharmacogenetics tools are not
recommended. In addition, these tests
may cost thousands of dollars and are
typically not covered by insurance.
For a pharmacogenetics tool to be
recommended for clinical use, studies
would need to reveal (1) the genetic
variants assayed have consistent,
replicated associations with
PEDIATRICS Volume 144, number 4, October 2019

medication response; (2) knowledge
about a patient’s genetic proﬁle
would change clinical decision-
making, improve outcomes and/or
reduce costs or burden; and (3) the
acceptability of the test’s operating
characteristics has been
demonstrated (eg, sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, and reliability).
Side Effects
Stimulants’ most common short-term
adverse effects are appetite loss,
abdominal pain, headaches, and
sleep disturbance. The Multimodal
Treatment of Attention Deﬁcit
Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study
results identiﬁed stimulants as having
a more persistent effect on decreasing
growth velocity compared to most
previous studies.110 Diminished
growth was in the range of 1 to 2 cm
from predicted adult height. The
results of the MTA study were
particularly noted among children
who were on higher and more
consistently administered doses of
stimulants.110 The effects diminished
by the third year of treatment, but no
compensatory rebound growth was
observed.110 An uncommon signiﬁcant
adverse effect of stimulants is the
occurrence of hallucinations and other
psychotic symptoms.111
Stimulant medications, on average,
increase patient heart rate (HR) and
blood pressure (BP) to a mild and
clinically insigniﬁcant degree (average
increases: 1–2 beats per minute for HR
and 1–4 mm Hg for systolic and
diastolic BP).112 However, because
stimulants have been linked to more
substantial increases in HR and BP in
a subset of individuals (5%–15%),
clinicians are encouraged to monitor
these vital signs in patients receiving
stimulant treatment.112 Although
concerns have been raised about
sudden cardiac death among children
and adolescents using stimulant and
medications,113 it is an extremely rare
occurrence. In fact, stimulant
medications have not been shown to
increase the risk of sudden death
beyond that observed in children who
are not receiving stimulants.114–118
Nevertheless, before initiating therapy
with stimulant medications, it is
important to obtain the child or
adolescent’s history of speciﬁc cardiac
symptoms in addition to the family
history of sudden death,
cardiovascular symptoms, Wolff-
Parkinson-White syndrome,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and
long QT syndrome. If any of these risk
factors are present, clinicians should
obtain additional evaluation to
ascertain and address potential safety
concerns of stimulant medication use
by the child or adolescent.112,114
Among nonstimulants, the risk of
serious cardiovascular events is
extremely low, as it is for stimulants.
The 3 nonstimulant medications that
are FDA approved to treat ADHD (ie,
atomoxetine, guanfacine, and
clonidine) may be associated with
changes in cardiovascular parameters
or other serious cardiovascular events.
These events could include increased
HR and BP for atomoxetine and
decreased HR and BP for guanfacine
and clonidine. Clinicians are
recommended to not only obtain the
personal and family cardiac history, as
detailed above, but also to perform
additional evaluation if risk factors are
present before starting nonstimulant
medications (ie, perform an
electrocardiogram [ECG] and possibly
refer to a pediatric cardiologist if the
ECG is not normal).112
Additional adverse effects of
atomoxetine include initial
somnolence and gastrointestinal tract
symptoms, particularly if the dosage is
increased too rapidly, and decreased
appetite.119–122 Less commonly, an
increase in suicidal thoughts has been
found; this is noted by an FDA black
box warning. Extremely rarely,
hepatitis has been associated with
atomoxetine. Atomoxetine has also
been linked to growth delays
compared to expected trajectories in
the ﬁrst 1 to 2 years of treatment, with
a return to expected measurements
after 2 to 3 years of treatment, on
average. Decreases were observed
among those who were taller or
heavier than average before
treatment.123
For extended-release guanfacine and
extended-release clonidine, adverse
effects include somnolence, dry
mouth, dizziness, irritability,
headache, bradycardia, hypotension,
and abdominal pain.30,124,125 Because
rebound hypertension after abrupt
guanfacine and clonidine
discontinuation has been
observed,126 these medications
should be tapered off rather than
suddenly discontinued.
Adjunctive Therapy
Adjunctive therapies may be
considered if stimulant therapy is not
fully effective or limited by side
effects. Only extended-release
guanfacine and extended-release
clonidine have evidence supporting
their use as adjunctive therapy with
stimulant medications sufﬁcient to
have achieved FDA approval.127 Other
medications have been used in
combination on an off-label basis,
with some limited evidence available
to support the efﬁcacy and safety of
using atomoxetine in combination
with stimulant medications to
augment treatment of ADHD.128
Special Circumstances: Preschool-Aged
Children (Age 4 Years to the Sixth
Birthday)
If children do not experience
adequate symptom improvement
with PTBM, medication can be
prescribed for those with moderate-
to-severe ADHD. Many young children
with ADHD may require medication
to achieve maximum improvement;
methylphenidate is the recommended
ﬁrst-line pharmacologic treatment of
preschool children because of the lack
of sufﬁcient rigorous study in the
preschool-aged population for
nonstimulant ADHD medications and
dextroamphetamine. Although
amphetamine is the only medication
14

Downloaded from 
with FDA approval for use in children
younger than 6 years, this authorization
was issued at a time when approval
criteria were less stringent than current
requirements. Hence, the available
evidence regarding dextroampheta-
mine’s use in preschool-aged children
with ADHD is not adequate to
recommend it as an initial ADHD
medication treatment at this time.80
No nonstimulant medication has
received sufﬁcient rigorous study in
the preschool-aged population to be
recommended for treatment of ADHD
of children 4 through 5 years of age.
Although methylphenidate is the
ADHD medication with the strongest
evidence for safety and efﬁcacy in
preschool-aged children, it should be
noted that the evidence has not yet
met the level needed for FDA
approval. Evidence for the use of
methylphenidate consists of 1
multisite study of 165 children83 and
10 other smaller, single-site studies
ranging from 11 to 59 children, for
a total of 269 children.129 Seven of the
10 single-site studies revealed efﬁcacy
for methylphenidate in preschoolers.
Therefore, although there is moderate
evidence that methylphenidate is safe
and effective in preschool-aged
children, its use in this age group
remains on an “off-label” basis.
With these caveats in mind, before
initiating treatment with medication,
the clinician should assess the severity
of the child’s ADHD. Given current
data, only preschool-aged children
with ADHD and moderate-to-severe
dysfunction should be considered for
medication. Severity criteria are
symptoms that have persisted for at
least 9 months; dysfunction that is
manifested in both home and other
settings, such as preschool or child
care; and dysfunction that has not
responded adequately to PTBM.83
The decision to consider initiating
medication at this age depends, in
part, on the clinician’s assessment
of the estimated developmental
impairment, safety risks, and potential
consequences if medications are not
initiated. Other considerations affecting
the treatment of preschool-aged
children with stimulant medications
include the lack of information and
experience about their longer-term
effects on growth and brain
development, as well as the potential
for other adverse effects in this
population. It may be helpful to obtain
consultation from a mental health
specialist with speciﬁc experience with
preschool-aged children, if possible.
Evidence suggests that the rate of
metabolizing methylphenidate is
slower in children 4 through 5 years of
age, so they should be given a low dose
to start; the dose can be increased in
smaller increments. Maximum doses
have not been adequately studied in
preschool-aged children.83
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
(Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday)
As noted, before beginning
medication treatment of adolescents
with newly diagnosed ADHD,
clinicians should assess the patient
for symptoms of substance use. If
active substance use is identiﬁed, the
clinician should refer the patient to
a subspecialist for consultative
support and guidance.2,1302134
In addition, diversion of ADHD
medication (ie, its use for something
other than its intended medical
purposes) is a special concern among
adolescents.135 Clinicians should
monitor the adolescent’s symptoms and
prescription reﬁll requests for signs of
misuse or diversion of ADHD
medication, including by parents,
classmates, or other acquaintances of
the adolescent. The majority of states
now require prescriber participation in
prescription drug monitoring programs,
which can be helpful in identifying and
preventing diversion activities. They
may consider prescribing nonstimulant
medications that minimize abuse
potential, such as atomoxetine and
extended-release guanfacine or
extended-release clonidine.
Given the risks of driving for
adolescents with ADHD, including
crashes and motor vehicle violations,
special concern should be taken to
provide medication coverage for
symptom control while
driving.79,136,137 Longer-acting or late-
afternoon, short-acting medications
may be helpful in this regard.138
Special Circumstances: Inattention
or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem
Level)
Medication is not appropriate for
children whose symptoms do not
meet DSM-5 criteria for ADHD.
Psychosocial treatments may be
appropriate for these children and
adolescents. As noted, psychosocial
treatments do not require a speciﬁc
diagnosis of ADHD, and many of the
studies on the efﬁcacy of PTBM
included children who did not have
a speciﬁc psychiatric or ADHD
diagnosis.
Combination Treatments
Studies indicate that behavioral
therapy has positive effects when it is
combined with medication for pre-
adolescent children.139 (The
combined effects of training
interventions and medication have
not been studied.)
In the MTA study, researchers found
that although the combination of
behavioral therapy and stimulant
medication was not signiﬁcantly more
effective than treatment with
medication alone for ADHD’s core
symptoms, after correcting for
multiple tests in the primary
analysis,139 a secondary analysis of
a combined measure of parent and
teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms
did ﬁnd a signiﬁcant advantage for
the combination, with a small effect of
d = 0.28.140 The combined treatment
also offered greater improvements on
academic and conduct measures,
compared to medication alone, when
the ADHD was comorbid with anxiety
and the child or adolescent lived in
a lower socioeconomic environment.

In addition, parents and teachers of
children who received combined
therapy reported that they were
signiﬁcantly more satisﬁed with the
treatment plan. Finally, the combination
of medication management and
behavioral therapy allowed for the use
of lower stimulant dosages, possibly
reducing the risk of adverse effects.141
School Programming and Supports
Encouraging strong family-school
partnerships helps the ADHD
management process.142 Psychosocial
treatments that include coordinating
efforts at school and home may
enhance the effects.
Children and adolescents with ADHD
may be eligible for services as part of
a 504 Rehabilitation Act Plan (504
plan) or special education IEP under
the “other health impairment”
designation in the Individuals with
Disability Education Act (IDEA).143
(ADHD qualiﬁes as a disability under
a 504 plan. It does not qualify under
an IEP unless its severity impairs the
child’s ability to learn. See the PoCA
for more details.) It is helpful for
clinicians to be aware of the eligibility
criteria in their states and school
districts to advise families of their
options. Eligibility decisions can vary
considerably between school
districts, and school professionals’
independent determinations might
not agree with the recommendations
of outside clinicians.
There are essentially 2 categories of
school-based services for students
with ADHD. The ﬁrst category
includes interventions that are
intended to help the student
independently meet age-appropriate
academic and behavioral
expectations. Examples of these
interventions include daily report
cards, training interventions, point
systems, and academic remediation of
skills. If successful, the student’s
impairment will resolve, and the
student will no longer need services.
The second category is intended to
provide changes in the student’s
program so his or her ADHD-related
problems no longer result in failure and
cause distress to parents, teachers, and
the student.144 These services are
referred to as “accommodations” and
include extended time to complete tests
and assignments, reduced homework
demands, the ability to keep study
materials in class, and provision of the
teacher’s notes to the student. These
services are intended to allow the
student to accomplish his work
successfully and communicate that the
student’s impairment is acceptable.
Accommodations make the student’s
impairment acceptable and are separate
from interventions aimed at improving
the students’ skills or behaviors. In the
absence of such interventions, long-
term accommodations may lead to
reduced expectations and can lead to
the need for accommodations to be
maintained throughout the student’s
education.
Encouraging strong family-school
partnerships helps the ADHD
management process, and addressing
social determinants of health is
essential to these partnerships.145,146
Psychosocial treatments that include
coordinating efforts at school and
home may enhance the effects.

The PCC should titrate doses of
medication for ADHD to achieve
maximum beneﬁt with tolerable side
effects (Table 9). (Grade B: strong
recommendation.)
The MTA study is the landmark study
comparing effects of methylphenidate
and behavioral treatments in children
with ADHD. Investigators compared
treatment effects in 4 groups of
children who received optimal
medication management, optimal
behavioral management, combined
medication and behavioral
management, or community treatment.
Children in the optimal medication
management and combined medication
and behavioral management groups
underwent a systematic trial with 4
different doses of methylphenidate, with
results suggesting that when this full
range of doses is administered, more
than 70% of children and adolescents
with ADHD are methylphenidate
responders.140
Authors of other reports suggest that
more than 90% of patients will have
a beneﬁcial response to 1 of the
psychostimulants if a range of
medications from both the
methylphenidate and amphetamine
and/or dextroamphetamine classes

are tried.147 Of note, children in the
MTA study who received care in the
community as usual, either from
a clinician they chose or to whom
their family had access, showed less
beneﬁcial results compared with
children who received optimal
medication management. The
explanation offered by the study
investigators was that the community
treatment group received lower
medication doses and less frequent
monitoring than the optimal
medication management group.
A child’s response to stimulants is
variable and unpredictable. For this
reason, it is recommended to titrate
from a low dose to one that achieves
a maximum, optimal effect in controlling
symptoms without adverse effects.
Calculating the dose on the basis of
milligrams per kilogram has not usually
been helpful because variations in dose
have not been found to be related to
height or weight. In addition, because
stimulant medication effects are seen
rapidly, titration can be accomplished in
a relatively short time period. Stimulant
medications can be effectively titrated
on a 7-day basis, but in urgent
situations, they may be effectively
titrated in as few as 3 days.140
Parent and child and adolescent
education is an important component
in the chronic illness model to ensure
cooperation in efforts to achieve
appropriate titration, remembering
that the parents themselves may be
signiﬁcantly challenged by
ADHD.148,149 The PCC should alert
parents and children that changing
medication dose and occasionally
changing a medication may be
necessary for optimal medication
management, may require a few
months to achieve optimal success,
and that medication efﬁcacy should
be monitored at regular intervals.
By the 3-year (ie, 36-month) follow-up
to the MTA interventions, there were
no differences among the 4 groups (ie,
optimal medications management,
optimal behavioral management,
a combination of medication and
behavioral management, and
community treatment). This
equivalence in poststudy outcomes
may, however, have been attributable
to convergence in ongoing treatments
received for the 4 groups. After the
initial 14-month intervention, the
children no longer received the careful
monthly monitoring provided by the
study and went back to receiving care
from their community providers;
therefore, they all effectively received
a level of ongoing care consistent with
the “community treatment” study arm
of the study. After leaving the MTA
trial, medications and doses varied for
the children who had been in the
optimal medication management or
combined medication and behavioral
management groups, and a number
stopped taking ADHD medication. On
the other hand, some children who
had been in the optimal behavioral
management group started taking
medication after leaving the trial. The
results further emphasize the need to
treat ADHD as a chronic illness and
provide continuity of care and, where
possible, provide a medical home.140
See the PoCA for more on
implementation of this KAS.
KAS 7
The PCC, if trained or experienced in
diagnosing comorbid conditions, may
initiate treatment of such conditions
or make a referral to an appropriate
subspecialist for treatment. After
detecting possible comorbid
conditions, if the PCC is not trained or
experienced in making the diagnosis
or initiating treatment, the patient
should be referred to an appropriate
subspecialist to make the diagnosis
and initiate treatment (Table 10).
(Grade C: recommendation.)
The effect of comorbid conditions on
ADHD treatment is variable. In some
cases, treatment of the ADHD may
resolve the comorbid condition. For
example, treatment of ADHD may
lead to improvement in coexisting
aggression and/or oppositional
deﬁant, depressive, or anxiety
symptoms.150,151
Sometimes, however, the comorbid
condition may require treatment in
addition to the ADHD treatment. If the
PCC is conﬁdent of his or her ability to
diagnose and treat certain comorbid
conditions, the PCC may do so. The
PCC may beneﬁt from additional
consultative support and guidance
from a mental health subspecialist or
may need to refer a child with ADHD
and comorbid conditions, such as
severe mood or anxiety disorders, to
subspecialists for assessment and
management. The subspecialists could
include child and adolescent
psychiatrists, clinical child
psychologists, developmental-
behavioral pediatricians,
neurodevelopmental disability
physicians, child neurologists, or
child- or school-based evaluation
teams.
IMPLEMENTATION: PREPARING THE
PRACTICE
It is generally the role of the primary
care pediatrician to manage mild-to-
moderate ADHD, anxiety, depression,
and substance use. The AAP
statement “The Future of Pediatrics:
Mental Health Competencies for
Pediatric Primary Care” describes the
competencies needed in both
pediatric primary and specialty care
to address the social-emotional and
mental health needs of children and
families.152 Broadly, these include
incorporating mental health content
and tools into health promotion,
prevention, and primary care
intervention, becoming
knowledgeable about use of
evidence-based treatments, and
participating as a team member and
comanaging with pediatric and
mental health specialists.
The recommendations made in this
guideline are intended to be integrated
with the broader mental health
algorithm developed as part of the AAP
Mental Health Initiatives.2,133,153

to identify conditions, including ADHD,
intervene early, and partner with both
families and specialists for the beneﬁt
of children’s health. A wealth of useful
information is available at the AAP
Mental Health Initiatives Web site
(https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-
and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/
Mental-Health/Pages/Tips-For-
Pediatricians.aspx).
It is also important for PCCs to be
aware of health disparities and social
determinants that may impact patient
outcomes and strive to provide
culturally appropriate care to all
children and adolescents in their
practice.145,146,154,155
The accompanying PoCA provides
supplemental information to support
PCCs as they implement this
guideline’s recommendations. In
particular, the PoCA describes steps
for preparing the practice that provide
useful recommendations to clinicians.
For example, the PoCA includes
information about using standardized
rating scales to diagnose ADHD,
assessing for comorbid conditions,
documenting all aspects of the
diagnostic and treatment procedures
in the patient’s records, monitoring
the patient’s treatment and outcomes,
and providing families with written
management plans.
The AAP acknowledges that some
PCCs may not have the training,
experience, or resources to diagnose
and treat children and adolescents
with ADHD, especially if severity or
comorbid conditions make these
patients complex to manage. In these
situations, comanagement with
specialty clinicians is recommended.
The SDBP is developing a guideline to
address such complex cases and aid
pediatricians and other PCCs to
manage these cases; the SDBP
currently expects to publish this
document in 2019.67
AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
There is a need to conduct research
on topics pertinent to the diagnosis
and treatment of ADHD,
developmental variations, and
problems in children and adolescents
in primary care. These research
opportunities include the following:
• assessment of ADHD and its
common comorbidities: anxiety,
depression, learning disabilities,
and autism spectrum disorder;
• identiﬁcation and/or development
of reliable instruments suitable for
use in primary care to assess the
nature or degree of functional
impairment in children and
adolescents with ADHD and to
monitor improvement over time;
• reﬁnement of developmentally
informed assessment procedures
for evaluating ADHD in
preschoolers;
• study of medications and other
therapies used clinically but not
FDA approved for ADHD;
• determination of the optimal
schedule for monitoring children
and adolescents with ADHD,
including factors for adjusting
that schedule according to age,
symptom severity, and progress
reports;
• evaluation of the effectiveness and
adverse effects of medications used
in combination, such as a stimulant
with an a-adrenergic agent,
selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor, or atomoxetine;
• evaluation of processes of care to
assist PCCs to identify and treat
comorbid conditions;
• evaluation of the effectiveness of
various school-based interventions;
• comparisons of medication use
and effectiveness in different
ages, including both harms and
beneﬁts;
• development of methods to involve
parents, children, and adolescents
in their own care and improve
adherence to both psychosocial and
medication treatments;
• conducting research into
psychosocial treatments, such as
cognitive behavioral therapy and
cognitive training, among others;
TABLE 10 KAS 7: The PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate treatment of such conditions or make a referral to an
appropriate subspecialist for treatment. After detecting possible comorbid conditions, if the PCC is not trained or experienced in making the
diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
Evidence is clear with regard to the
legitimacy of the diagnosis of ADHD
and the appropriate diagnostic
criteria and procedures required to
establish a diagnosis, identify
comorbid conditions, and effectively
treat with both psychosocial and
pharmacologic interventions. The
steps required to sustain appropriate
treatments and achieve successful
long-term outcomes remain
challenging, however.
As noted, this clinical practice
guideline is supported by 2

barriers to the car of children and
adolescents with ADHD. Full
implementation of the guideline’s
KASs, the PoCA, and the
recommendations to address barriers
to care may require changes in ofﬁce
procedures and the identiﬁcation of
community resources. Fully
addressing systemic barriers requires
identifying local, state, and national
entities with which to partner to
advance solutions and manifest

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common
neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and can profoundly affect the
academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions of children;
the American Academy of Pediatrics ﬁrst published clinical recommen-
dations for the diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD in children in 2000;
recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. Pediatrics 2011;128:
1007–1022
Summary of key action statements:
1. The primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for
any child 4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or
behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or
impulsivity (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).
2. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the primary care clinician should
determine that Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, Fourth Edition criteria have been met (including documenta-
tion of impairment in more than 1 major setting); information
should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or guard-
ians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians in-
volved in the child’s care. The primary care clinician should also rule
out
any
alternative
cause
(quality
of
evidence
B/strong
recommendation).
3. In the evaluation of a child for ADHD, the primary care clinician
should include assessment for other conditions that might coexist
with ADHD, including emotional or behavioral (eg, anxiety, depres-
sive, oppositional deﬁant, and conduct disorders), developmental
(eg, learning and language disorders or other neurodevelopmental
disorders), and physical (eg, tics, sleep apnea) conditions (quality of
evidence B/strong recommendation).
4. The primary care clinician should recognize ADHD as a chronic
condition and, therefore, consider children and adolescents
with ADHD as children and youth with special health care needs.
Management of children and youth with special health care
needs should follow the principles of the chronic care model and
the medical home (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

5. Recommendations for treatment of
children and youth with ADHD vary
depending on the patient’s age:
a. For
preschool-aged
children
(4–5 years of age), the primary
care clinician should prescribe
evidence-based parent- and/or
teacher-administered behavior
therapy as the ﬁrst line of treat-
ment
(quality
of
evidence
A/strong recommendation) and
may prescribe methylphenidate
if the behavior interventions do
not provide signiﬁcant improve-
ment and there is moderate-to-
severe continuing disturbance
in the child’s function. In areas
where evidence-based behav-
ioral treatments are not avail-
able, the clinician needs to
weigh the risks of starting med-
ication at an early age against
the harm of delaying diagnosis
and treatment (quality of evi-
dence B/recommendation).
b. For
elementary
school–aged
children (6–11 years of age), the
primary care clinician should
prescribe US Food and Drug
Administration–approved medica-
tions for ADHD (quality of evi-
dence A/strong recommendation)
and/or evidence-based parent-
and/or
teacher-administered
behavior therapy as treatment
for ADHD, preferably both (qual-
ity of evidence B/strong recom-
mendation). The evidence is par-
ticularly strong for stimulant
medications and sufﬁcient but
less strong for atomoxetine,
extended-release
guanfacine,
and extended-release clonidine
(in that order) (quality of evi-
dence A/strong recommenda-
tion). The school environment,
program, or placement is a part
of any treatment plan.
c. For adolescents (12–18 years of
age), the primary care clinician
should
prescribe
Food
and
Drug Administration–approved
medications for ADHD with the
assent of the adolescent (qual-
ity of evidence A/strong recom-
mendation) and may prescribe
behavior therapy as treatment
for ADHD (quality of evidence
C/recommendation), preferably
both.
6. The primary care clinician should
titrate doses of medication for
ADHD to achieve maximum beneﬁt
with
minimum
adverse
effects
(quality
of
evidence
B/strong
recommendation).
INTRODUCTION
This document updates and replaces 2
previously published clinical guide-
lines from the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) on the diagnosis and
treatment of attention-deﬁcit/hyperac-
tivity disorder (ADHD) in children:
“Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis
and Evaluation of the Child With Atten-
tion-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder”
(2000)1 and “Clinical Practice Guide-
line: Treatment of the School-aged
Child With Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactiv-
ity Disorder” (2001).2 Since these
guidelines were published, new infor-
mation and evidence regarding the di-
agnosis and treatment of ADHD has be-
come available. Surveys conducted
before and after the publication of the
previous guidelines have also provided
insight into pediatricians’ attitudes
and practices regarding ADHD. On the
basis of an increased understanding
regarding ADHD and the challenges it
raises for children and families and as
a source for clinicians seeking to diag-
nose and treat children, this guideline
pays particular attention to a number
of areas.
Expanded Age Range
The previous guidelines addressed di-
agnosis and treatment of ADHD in chil-
dren 6 through 12 years of age. There
is now emerging evidence to expand
the age range of the recommendations
to include preschool-aged children
and adolescents. This guideline ad-
dresses the diagnosis and treatment
of ADHD in children 4 through 18 years
of age, and attention is brought to spe-
cial circumstances or concerns in par-
ticular age groups when appropriate.
Expanded Scope
Behavioral interventions might help
families of children with hyperactive/
impulsive behaviors that do not meet
full diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Guid-
ance
regarding
the
diagnosis
of
problem-level concerns in children
based on the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual for Primary Care (DSM-PC),
Child and Adolescent Version,3 as well
as suggestions for treatment and care
of children and families with problem-
level concerns, are provided here. The
current DSM-PC was published in 1996
and, therefore, is not consistent with
intervening changes to International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-9-CM).
Although this version of the DSM-PC
should not be used as a deﬁnitive
source for diagnostic codes related to
ADHD and comorbid conditions, it cer-
tainly may continue to be used as a
resource for enriching the under-
standing of ADHD manifestations. The
DSM-PC will be revised when both the
DSM-V and ICD-10 are available for use.
A Process of Care for Diagnosis
and Treatment
This guideline and process-of-care al-
gorithm (see Supplemental Fig 2 and
Supplemental Appendix) recognizes
evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment
as a continuous process and provides
recommendations for both the guide-
line and the algorithm in this single
publication. In addition to the formal
recommendations for assessment, di-
agnosis, and treatment, this guideline
1008

Downloaded from 
provides a single algorithm to guide
the clinical process.
Integration With the Task Force on
Mental Health
This guideline ﬁts into the broader
mission of the AAP Task Force on
Mental Health and its efforts to pro-
vide a base from which primary care
providers can develop alliances with
families, work to prevent mental
health conditions and identify them
early, and collaborate with mental
health clinicians.
The diagnosis and management of
ADHD in children and youth has been
particularly challenging for primary
care clinicians because of the limited
payment provided for what requires
more time than most of the other con-
ditions they typically address. The pro-
cedures recommended in this guide-
line necessitate spending more time
with patients and families, developing
a system of contacts with school and
other personnel, and providing contin-
uous, coordinated care, all of which is
time demanding. In addition, relegating
mental health conditions exclusively to
mental health clinicians also is not a via-
blesolutionformanyclinicians,because
in many areas access to mental health
clinicians to whom they can refer pa-
tients is limited. Access in many areas is
also limited to psychologists when fur-
ther assessment of cognitive issues is
required and not available through the
education system because of restric-
tions from third-party payers in paying
for the evaluations on the basis of them
being
educational
and
not
health
related.
Cultural differences in the diagnosis and
treatment of ADHD are an important is-
sue, as they are for all pediatric condi-
tions. Because the diagnosis and treat-
ment of ADHD depends to a great extent
onfamilyandteacherperceptions,these
issuesmightbeevenmoreprominentan
issue for ADHD. Speciﬁc cultural issues
are beyond the scope of this guideline
but are important to consider.
METHODOLOGY
As with the 2 previously published clin-
ical guidelines, the AAP collaborated
with several organizations to develop a
working subcommittee that repre-
sented a wide range of primary care
and subspecialty groups. The subcom-
mittee included primary care pediatri-
cians, developmental-behavioral pedi-
atricians, and representatives from
the American Academy of Child and Ad-
olescent Psychiatry, the Child Neurol-
ogy Society, the Society for Pediatric
Psychology, the National Association of
School Psychologists, the Society for
Developmental and Behavioral Pediat-
rics, the American Academy of Family
Physicians, and Children and Adults
With
Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder (CHADD), as well as an epide-
miologist from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).
This group met over a 2-year period,
during which it reviewed the changes
in practice that have occurred and is-
sues that have been identiﬁed since
the previous guidelines were pub-
lished. Delay in completing the process
led to further conference calls and ex-
tended the years of literature reviewed
in order to remain as current as pos-
sible. The AAP funded the development
of this guideline; potential ﬁnancial
conﬂicts of the participants were iden-
tiﬁed and taken into consideration in
the deliberations. The guideline will be
reviewed and/or revised in 5 years un-
less new evidence emerges that war-
rants revision sooner.
The subcommittee developed a series
of research questions to direct an ex-
tensive evidence-based review in part-
nership with the CDC and the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center. The diagnostic review was con-
ducted by the CDC, and the evidence
was evaluated in a combined effort of
the AAP, CDC, and University of Okla-
homa Health Sciences Center staff. The
treatment-related evidence relied on a
recent evidence review by the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality
and was supplemented by evidence
identiﬁed through the CDC review.
The diagnostic issues were focused on
5 areas:
1. ADHD prevalence—speciﬁcally: (a)
What percentage of the general US
population
aged
21
years
or
younger has ADHD? (b) What per-
centage of patients presenting at
pediatricians’ or family physicians’
ofﬁces in the United States meet di-
agnostic criteria for ADHD?
2. Co-occurring
mental
disorders—
of people with ADHD, what percent-
age has 1 or more of the following
co-occurring conditions: sleep dis-
orders, learning disabilities, de-
pression, anxiety, conduct disorder,
and oppositional deﬁant disorder?
3. What are the functional impair-
ments of children and youth diag-
nosed with ADHD? Speciﬁcally, in
what domains and to what degree
do youth with ADHD demonstrate
impairments in functional domains,
including peer relations, academic
performance, adaptive skills, and
family functioning?
4. Do behavior rating scales remain
the standard of care in assessing
the diagnostic criteria for ADHD?
5. What is the prevalence of abnormal
ﬁndings
on
selected
medical
screening tests commonly recom-
mended as standard components
of an evaluation of a child with sus-
pected ADHD? How accurate are
these tests in the diagnosis of ADHD
compared with a reference stan-
dard (ie, what are the psychometric
properties of these tests)?
The treatment issues were focused on
3 areas:
1. What new information is available

PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Number 5, November 2011

Downloaded from 
regarding the long-term efﬁcacy
and safety of medications approved
by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) for the treatment of
ADHD (stimulants and nonstimu-
lants), and speciﬁcally, what infor-
mation is available about the
efﬁcacy and safety of these medi-
cations in preschool-aged and ado-
lescent patients?
2. What evidence is available about the
long-term efﬁcacy and safety of psy-
chosocial interventions (behavioral
modiﬁcation) for the treatment of
ADHD for children, and speciﬁcally,
what information is available about
the efﬁcacy and safety of these inter-
ventions in preschool-aged and ado-
lescent patients?
3. Are there any additional therapies
that reach the level of consider-
ation as evidence based?
Evidence-Review Process for
Diagnosis
A multilevel, systematic approach was
taken to identify the literature that
built the evidence base for both diag-
nosis and treatment. To increase the
likelihood that relevant articles were
included in the ﬁnal evidence base, the
reviewers ﬁrst conducted a scoping
review of the literature by systemati-
cally searching literature using rele-
vant key words and then summarized
the primary ﬁndings of articles that
met standard inclusion criteria. The
reviewers then created evidence ta-
bles that were reviewed by content-
area experts who were best able to
identify articles that might have been
missed through the scoping review. Ar-
ticles that were missed were reviewed
carefully to determine where the ab-
straction methodology failed, and ad-
justments to the search strategy were
made as required (see technical re-
port to be published). Finally, although
published literature reviews did not
contribute directly to the evidence
base, the articles included in review
articles were cross-referenced with
the ﬁnal evidence tables to ensure that
all relevant articles were included in
the ﬁnal evidence tables.
For the scoping review, articles were
abstracted in a stratiﬁed fashion from
3 article-retrieval systems that pro-
vided access to articles in the domains
of medicine, psychology, and educa-
tion: PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sites/entrez), PsycINFO (www.apa.org/
pubs/databases/psycinfo/index.aspx),
and ERIC (www.eric.ed.gov). English-
language, peer-reviewed articles pub-
lished between 1998 and 2009 were
queried in the 3 search engines. Key
words were selected with the intent of
including all possible articles that
might have been relevant to 1 or more
of the questions of interest (see the
technical report to be published). The
primary abstraction included the fol-
lowing terms: “attention deﬁcit hyper-
activity disorder” or “attention deﬁcit
disorder”
or
“hyperkinesis”
and
“child.” A second, independent ab-
straction was conducted to identify ar-
ticles related to medical screening
tests for ADHD. For this abstraction,
the same search terms were used as
in the previous procedure along with
the additional condition term “behav-
ioral problems” to allow for the inclu-
sion of studies of youth that sought to
diagnose ADHD by using medical
screening tests. Abstractions were
conducted in parallel fashion across
each of the 3 databases; the results
from each abstraction (complete ref-
erence, abstract, and key words) were
exported and compiled into a common
reference database using EndNote
10.0.4 References were subsequently
and systematically deduplicated by us-
ing the software’s deduplication pro-
cedure. References for books, chap-
ters, and theses were also deleted
from the library. Once a deduplicated
library was developed, the semiﬁnal
database of 8267 references was re-
viewed for inclusion on the basis of
inclusion criteria listed in the techni-
cal report. Included articles were
then pulled in their entirety, the in-
clusion criteria were reconﬁrmed,
and then the study ﬁndings were
summarized in evidence tables. The
articles included in relevant review
articles were revisited to ensure
their inclusion in the ﬁnal evidence
base. The evidence tables were then
presented to the committee for ex-
pert review.
Evidence-Review Process for
Treatment
In addition to this systematic review,
for treatment we used the review from
the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ) Effective Health-
care Program “Attention Deﬁcit Hyper-
activity
Disorder:
Effectiveness
of
Treatment in At-Risk Preschoolers;
Long-term Effectiveness in All Ages;
and Variability in Prevalence, Diagno-
sis, and Treatment.”5 This review ad-
dressed a number of key questions for
the committee, including the efﬁcacy
of medications and behavioral inter-
ventions for preschoolers, children,
and adolescents. Evidence identiﬁed
through the systematic evidence re-
view for diagnosis was also used as a
secondary data source to supplement
the evidence presented in the AHRQ re-
port. The draft practice guidelines
were developed by consensus of the
committee regarding the evidence. It
was decided to create 2 separate com-
ponents. The guideline recommenda-
tions were based on clear character-
ization of the evidence. The second
component is a practice-of-care algo-
rithm (see Supplemental Fig 2) that
provides considerably more detail
about how to implement the guidelines
but is, necessarily, based less on avail-
able evidence and more on consensus
of the committee members. When data

the guidelines, a combination of evi-
dence and expert consensus was used.
Action statements labeled “strong rec-
ommendation” or “recommendation”
were based on high- to moderate-
quality scientiﬁc evidence and a pre-
ponderance of beneﬁt over harm.6
Option-level action statements were
based on lesser-quality or limited
data and expert consensus or high-
quality evidence with a balance be-
tween beneﬁts and harms. These
clinical options are interventions
that a reasonable health care pro-
vider might or might not wish to im-
plement in his or her practice. The
quality of evidence supporting each
recommendation and the strength of
each
recommendation
were
as-
sessed by the committee member
most experienced in epidemiology
and graded according to AAP policy
(Fig 1).6
The guidelines and process-of-care
algorithm underwent extensive peer
review
by
committees,
sections,
councils, and task forces within the
AAP; numerous outside organiza-
tions; and other individuals identi-
ﬁed by the subcommittee. Liaisons to
the subcommittee also were invited
to distribute the draft to entities
within their organizations. The re-
sulting comments were compiled
and reviewed by the chairperson,
and relevant changes were incorpo-
rated into the draft, which was then
reviewed by the full committee.
ABOUT THIS GUIDELINE
Key Action Statements
In light of the concerns highlighted
previously and informed by the avail-
able evidence, the AAP has developed
6 action statements for the evalua-
tion, diagnosis, and treatment of
ADHD in children. These action state-
ments provide for consistent and
quality care for children and families
with concerns about or symptoms
that suggest attention disorders or
problems.
Context
This guideline is intended to be inte-
grated with the broader algorithms
developed as part of the mission of
the AAP Task Force on Mental Health.7
Implementation: A Process-of-Care
Algorithm
The AAP recognizes the challenge of
instituting practice changes and
adopting new recommendations for
care. To address the need, a process-
of-care algorithm has been devel-
oped and has been used in the revi-
sion of the AAP ADHD toolkit.
Implementation: Preparing the
Practice
Full implementation of the action
statements described in this guideline
and the process-of-care algorithm
might require changes in ofﬁce proce-
dures and/or preparatory efforts to
identify community resources. The
section titled “Preparing the Practice”
in the process-of-care algorithm and
further information can be found in
the supplement to the Task Force on
Mental Health report.7 It is important
to document all aspects of the diagnos-
tic and treatment procedures in the
patients’ records. Use of rating scales
for the diagnosis of ADHD and assess-
ment for comorbid conditions and as a
method for monitoring treatment as
described in the process algorithm
(see Supplemental Fig 2), as well as
information provided to parents such
as management plans, can help facili-
tate a clinician’s accurate documenta-
tion of his or her process.
Note
The AAP acknowledges that some pri-
mary care clinicians might not be
conﬁdent of their ability to success-
fully diagnose and treat ADHD in a
child because of the child’s age, co-
existing conditions, or other con-
cerns. At any point at which a clini-
cian feels that he or she is not
adequately trained or is uncertain
about making a diagnosis or continu-
ing with treatment, a referral to a
pediatric or mental health subspe-
cialist should be made. If a diagnosis
of ADHD or other condition is made
by a subspecialist, the primary care
clinician should develop a manage-
ment strategy with the subspecialist
that ensures that the child will con-
tinue to receive appropriate care
consistent with a medical home
model wherein the pediatrician part-

KEY ACTION STATEMENTS FOR THE
EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS,
TREATMENT, AND MONITORING OF
ADHD IN CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS
Action statement 1: The primary
care clinician should initiate an
evaluation for ADHD for any child 4
through 18 years of age who pres-
ents with academic or behavioral
problems and symptoms of inatten-
tion, hyperactivity, or impulsivity
(quality
of
evidence
B/strong
recommendation).
Evidence Proﬁle
●Aggregate evidence quality: B.
●Beneﬁts: In a considerable number of
children, ADHD goes undiagnosed. Pri-
mary care clinicians’ systematic iden-
tiﬁcation of children with these prob-
lems will likely decrease the rate of
undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in
children.
●Harms/risks/costs: Children in whom
ADHD
is
inappropriately
diagnosed
might be labeled inappropriately, or an-
other condition might be missed, and
they might receive treatments that will
not beneﬁt them.
●Beneﬁts-harms assessment: The high
prevalence of ADHD and limited mental
health resources require primary care
pediatricians to play a signiﬁcant role in
the care of their patients with ADHD so
that children with this condition receive
the appropriate diagnosis and treat-
ment. Treatments available have shown
good evidence of efﬁcacy, and lack of
treatment results in a risk for impaired
outcomes.
●Value judgments: The committee con-
sidered the requirements for establish-
ing the diagnosis, the prevalence of
ADHD, and the efﬁcacy and adverse ef-
fects of treatment as well as the long-
term outcomes.
●Role of patient preferences: Success
with treatment depends on patient and
family preference, which has to be taken
into account.
●Exclusions: None.
●Intentional vagueness: The limits be-
tween what can be handled by a primary
care clinician and what should be re-
ferred to a subspecialist because of the
varying degrees of skills among primary
care clinicians.
●Strength: strong recommendation.
The basis for this recommendation is
essentially unchanged from that in
the previous guideline. ADHD is the
most common neurobehavioral dis-
order in children and occurs in ap-
proximately 8% of children and
youth8–10; the number of children with
this condition is far greater than can
be managed by the mental health
system. There is now increased evi-
dence that appropriate diagnosis can
be provided for preschool-aged chil-
dren11 (4–5 years of age) and for
adolescents.12
Action statement 2: To make a diag-
nosis of ADHD, the primary care cli-
nician should determine that Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV-TR) criteria have been met
(including documentation of im-
pairment in more than 1 major set-
ting), and information should be
obtained primarily from reports
from parents or guardians, teach-
ers, and other school and mental
health clinicians involved in the
child’s care. The primary care clini-
cian should also rule out any alter-
native cause (quality of evidence
B/strong recommendation).
Evidence Proﬁle
●Aggregate evidence quality: B.
●Beneﬁts: The use of DSM-IV criteria has
lead to more uniform categorization of
the
condition
across
professional
disciplines.
●Harms/risks/costs: The DSM-IV sys-
tem does not speciﬁcally provide for
developmental-level
differences
and
might lead to some misdiagnoses.
●Beneﬁts-harms assessment: The ben-
eﬁts far outweigh the harm.
●Value judgments: The committee took
into consideration the importance of co-
ordination between pediatric and men-
tal health services.
●Role of patient preferences: Although
there is some stigma associated with
mental disorder diagnoses resulting in
some families preferring other diagno-
ses, the need for better clarity in diag-
noses
was
felt
to
outweigh
this
preference.
●Exclusions: None.
●Intentional vagueness: None.
●Strength: strong recommendation.
As with the ﬁndings in the previous
guideline, the DSM-IV criteria con-
tinue to be the criteria best sup-
ported by evidence and consensus.
Developed through several itera-
tions by the American Psychiatric As-
sociation, the DSM-IV criteria were
created through use of consensus
and an expanding research founda-
tion.13 The DSM-IV system is used by
professionals in psychiatry, psychol-
ogy, health care systems, and pri-
mary care. Use of DSM-IV criteria, in
addition to having the best evidence
to date for criteria for ADHD, also af-
fords the best method for communi-
cation across clinicians and is estab-
lished with third-party payers. The
criteria are under review for the de-
velopment of the DSM-V, but these
changes will not be available until at
least 1 year after the publication of
this current guideline. The diagnos-
tic criteria have not changed since
the previous guideline and are pre-
sented in Supplemental Table 2. An
anticipated change in the DSM-V is
increasing the age limit for when
ADHD needs to have ﬁrst presented
from 7 to 12 years.14

Special Circumstances: Preschool-
aged Children (4–5 Years Old)
There is evidence that the diagnostic
criteria for ADHD can be applied to
preschool-aged children; however, the
subtypes detailed in the DSM-IV might
not be valid for this population.15–21 A
review of the literature, including the
multisite study of the efﬁcacy of meth-
ylphenidate in preschool-aged chil-
dren, revealed that the criteria could
appropriately identify children with
the condition.11 However, there are
added challenges in determining the
presence of key symptoms. Preschool-
aged children are not likely to have a
separate observer if they do not attend
a preschool or child care program,
and even if they do attend, staff in
those programs might be less quali-
ﬁed than certiﬁed teachers to provide
accurate observations. Here, too, fo-
cused checklists can help physicians
in the diagnostic evaluation, although
only the Conners Comprehensive Be-
havior Rating Scales and the ADHD Rat-
ing Scale IV are DSM-IV–based scales
that have been validated in preschool-
aged children.22
When there are concerns about the
availability or quality of nonparent ob-
servations of a child’s behavior, physi-
cians may recommend that parents
complete a parent-training program
before conﬁrming an ADHD diagnosis
for preschool-aged children and con-
sider placement in a qualiﬁed pre-
school program if they have not done
so already. Information can be ob-
tained from parents and teachers
through the use of validated DSM-IV–
based ADHD rating scales. The parent-
training program must include helping
parents develop age-appropriate de-
velopmental expectations and speciﬁc
management skills for problem behav-
iors. The clinician may obtain reports
from the parenting class instructor
about the parents’ ability to manage
their children, and if the children are
in programs in which they are directly
observed, instructors can report infor-
mation about the core symptoms and
function of the child directly. Qualiﬁed
preschool
programs
include
pro-
grams such as Head Start or other
public
prekindergarten
programs.
Preschool-aged children who display
signiﬁcant emotional or behavioral
concerns might also qualify for Early
Childhood Special Education services
through their local school districts,
and the evaluators for these programs
and/or Early Childhood Special Educa-
tion teachers might be excellent re-
porters of core symptoms.
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
Obtaining teacher reports for adoles-
cents might be more challenging, be-
cause many adolescents will have mul-
tiple teachers. Likewise, parents might
have less opportunity to observe their
adolescent’s behaviors than they had
when their children were younger. Ad-
olescents’ reports of their own behav-
iors often differ from those of other
observers, because they tend to mini-
mize their own problematic behav-
iors.23–25 Adolescents are less likely to
exhibit overt hyperactive behavior. De-
spite the difﬁculties, clinicians need to
try to obtain (with agreement from the
adolescent) information from at least
2 teachers as well as information from
other sources such as coaches, school
guidance counselors, or leaders of
community activities in which the ado-
lescent participates. In addition, it is
unusual for adolescents with behav-
ioral/attention problems not to have
been previously given a diagnosis of
ADHD. Therefore, it is important to es-
tablish the younger manifestations of
the condition that were missed and to
strongly consider substance use, de-
pression, and anxiety as alternative or
co-occurring diagnoses. Adolescents
with ADHD, especially when untreated,
are at greater risk of substance
abuse.26 In addition, the risks of
mood and anxiety disorders and risky
sexual
behaviors
increase
during
adolescence.12
Special Circumstances: Inattention or
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem
Level)
Teachers, parents, and child health
professionals typically encounter chil-
dren with behaviors relating to activity
level, impulsivity, and inattention who
might not fully meet DSM-IV criteria.
The DSM-PC3 provides a guide to the
more common behaviors seen in pedi-
atrics. The manual describes common
variations in behavior as well as more
problematic behaviors at levels of less
impairment than those speciﬁed in the
DSM-IV.
The behavioral descriptions of the
DSM-PC have not yet been tested in
community studies to determine the
prevalence or severity of developmen-
tal variations and problems in the ar-
eas of inattention, hyperactivity, or im-
pulsivity. They do, however, provide
guidance to clinicians regarding ele-
ments of treatment for children with
problems with mild-to-moderate inat-
tention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.
The DSM-PC also considers environ-
mental inﬂuences on a child’s behavior
and provides information on differen-
tial diagnosis with a developmental
perspective.
Action statement 3: In the evalua-
tion of a child for ADHD, the primary
care clinician should include as-
sessment for other conditions that
might coexist with ADHD, includ-
ing emotional or behavioral (eg,
anxiety, depressive, oppositional
deﬁant, and conduct disorders),
developmental (eg, learning and
language disorders or other neu-
rodevelopmental disorders), and
physical (eg, tics, sleep apnea)
conditions
(quality
of
evidence
B/strong recommendation).

tions is important for developing the
most appropriate treatment plan.
●Harms/risks/costs:Themajorriskis mis-
diagnosing the conditions and providing

A variety of other behavioral, develop-
mental, and physical conditions can
coexist in children who are evaluated
for ADHD. These conditions include,
but are not limited to, learning prob-
lems, language disorder, disruptive
behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, tic
disorders, seizures, developmental co-
ordination disorder, or sleep disor-
ders.23,24,27–38 In some cases, the pres-
ence of a coexisting condition will alter
the treatment of ADHD. The primary
care clinician might beneﬁt from addi-
tional support and guidance or might
need to refer a child with ADHD and
coexisting conditions, such as severe
mood or anxiety disorders, to subspe-
cialists for assessment and manage-
ment. The subspecialists could include
child
psychiatrists,
developmental-
behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelop-
mental
disability
physicians,
child
neurologists,
or
child
or
school
psychologists.
Given the likelihood that another
condition exists, primary care clini-
cians should conduct assessments
that determine or at least identify
the risk of coexisting conditions.
Through its Task Force on Mental
Health, the AAP has developed algo-
rithms and a toolkit39 for assessing
and treating (or comanaging) the
most common developmental disor-
ders and mental health concerns in
children. These resources might be
useful in assessing children who are
being evaluated for ADHD. Payment
for evaluation and treatment must
cover the ﬁxed and variable costs of
providing the services, as noted in
the AAP policy statement “Scope of
Health Care Beneﬁts for Children
From Birth Through Age 26.40
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
Clinicians should assess adolescent
patients with newly diagnosed ADHD
for symptoms and signs of substance
abuse; when these signs and symp-
toms are found, evaluation and treat-
ment for addiction should precede
treatment for ADHD, if possible, or
careful treatment for ADHD can begin
if necessary.25
Action statement 4: The primary
care clinician should recognize
ADHD
as
a
chronic
condition
and, therefore, consider children
and adolescents with ADHD as
children and youth with special
health care needs. Management
of
children
and
youth
with
special health care needs should
follow
the
principles
of
the
chronic care model and the medi-
cal home (quality of evidence
B/strong recommendation).
Evidence Proﬁle
●Aggregate evidence quality: B.
●Beneﬁts:
The
recommendation
de-
scribes the coordinated services most
appropriate for managing the condition.
●Harms/risks/costs: Providing the ser-
vices might be more costly.
●Beneﬁts-harms assessment: There is a
preponderance of beneﬁt over harm.
●Value judgments: The committee mem-
bers considered the value of medical

this recommendation.
●Role of patient preferences: Family
preference in how these services are
provided is an important consideration.
●Exclusions: None.
●Intentional vagueness: None.
●Strength: strong recommendation.
As in the previous guideline, this rec-
ommendation is based on the evi-
dence that ADHD continues to cause
symptoms and dysfunction in many
children who have the condition over
long periods of time, even into adult-
hood, and that the treatments avail-
able address symptoms and function
but are usually not curative. Al-
though the chronic illness model has
not been speciﬁcally studied in chil-
dren and youth with ADHD, it has
been effective for other chronic con-
ditions such as asthma,23 and the
medical home model has been ac-
cepted as the preferred standard of
care.41 The management process is
also helped by encouraging strong
family-school partnerships.42
Longitudinal studies have found that,
frequently, treatments are not sus-
tained despite the fact that long-
term outcomes for children with
ADHD indicate that they are at
greater risk of signiﬁcant problems
if they discontinue treatment.43 Be-
cause a number of parents of chil-
dren with ADHD also have ADHD, ex-
tra support might be necessary to
help those parents provide medica-
tion on a consistent basis and insti-
tute a consistent behavioral pro-
gram. The medical home and chronic
illness approach is provided in the
process
algorithm
(Supplemental
Fig 2). An important process in ongo-
ing care is bidirectional communica-
tion with teachers and other school
and mental health clinicians involved
in the child’s care as well as with
parents and patients.

Medication
Similar to the recommendations from
the previous guideline, stimulant med-
ications are highly effective for most
children in reducing core symptoms of
ADHD.44 One selective norepinephrine-
reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine45,46)
and 2 selective 2-adrenergic agonists
(extended-release guanfacine47,48 and
extended-release
clonidine49)
have
also demonstrated efﬁcacy in re-
ducing
core
symptoms.
Because
norepinephrine-reuptake
inhibitors
and 2-adrenergic agonists are newer,
the
evidence
base
that
supports
them—although adequate for FDA
approval—is
considerably
smaller
than that for stimulants. None of them
have
been
approved
for
use
in
preschool-aged children. Compared
with stimulant medications that have
an effect size [effect size  (treatment
mean  control mean)/control SD] of
approximately 1.0,50 the effects of the
nonstimulants are slightly weaker;
atomoxetine has an effect size of ap-
proximately 0.7, and extended-release
guanfacine and extended-release clo-
nidine also have effect sizes of approx-
imately 0.7.
The accompanying process-of-care al-
gorithm provides a list of the currently
available FDA-approved medications
for ADHD (Supplemental Table 3). Char-
acteristics of each medication are pro-
vided to help guide the clinician’s
choice in prescribing medication.
As was identiﬁed in the previous guide-
line, the most common stimulant ad-
verse effects are appetite loss, abdom-
inal
pain,
headaches,
and
sleep
disturbance. The results of the Multi-
modal Therapy of ADHD (MTA) study re-
vealed a more persistent effect of stim-
ulants on decreasing growth velocity
than have most previous studies, par-
ticularly when children were on higher
and more consistently administered
doses. The effects diminished by the
third year of treatment, but no com-
pensatory
rebound
effects
were
found.51 However, diminished growth
was in the range of 1 to 2 cm. An un-
common additional signiﬁcant ad-
verse effect of stimulants is the occur-
rence of hallucinations and other
psychotic symptoms.52 Although con-
cerns have been raised about the rare
occurrence of sudden cardiac death
among children using stimulant medi-
cations,53 sudden death in children on
stimulant medication is extremely
rare, and evidence is conﬂicting as to
whether stimulant medications in-
crease the risk of sudden death.54–56 It
is important to expand the history to
include speciﬁc cardiac symptoms,
Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, sud-
den death in the family, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, and long QT syn-
drome. Preschool-aged children might
experience increased mood lability
and dysphoria.57 For the nonstimulant
atomoxetine, the adverse effects in-
clude initial somnolence and gastroin-
testinal tract symptoms, particularly if
the dosage is increased too rapidly; de-
crease in appetite; increase in suicidal
thoughts (less common); and hepatitis
(rare).
For
the
nonstimulant
2-
adrenergic agonists extended-release
guanfacine and extended-release clo-
nidine, adverse effects include somno-
lence and dry mouth.
Only 2 medications have evidence to
support their use as adjunctive ther-
apy with stimulant medications sufﬁ-
cient
to
achieve
FDA
approval:
extended-release
guanfacine26
and
extended-release
clonidine.
Other
medications have been used in combi-
nation off-label, but there is currently
only anecdotal evidence for their
safety or efﬁcacy, so their use cannot
be recommended at this time.
Special Circumstances: Preschool-
aged Children
A number of special circumstances
support the recommendation to initi-
ate ADHD treatment in preschool-aged
children (ages 4–5 years) with behav-
ioral therapy alone ﬁrst.57 These cir-
cumstances include:
●The multisite study of methylpheni-
date57 was limited to preschool-
aged children who had moderate-
to-severe dysfunction.
●The study also found that many chil-
dren (ages 4–5 years) experience
improvements in symptoms with
behavior therapy alone, and the
overall evidence for behavior ther-
apy in preschool-aged children is
strong.
●Behavioral programs for children 4
to 5 years of age typically run in the
form of group parent-training pro-
grams and, although not always
compensated by health insurance,
have a lower cost. The process algo-
rithm (see Supplemental pages s15-
16) contains criteria for the clini-
cian to use in assessing the quality
of the behavioral therapy. In addi-
tion, programs such as Head Start
and Children and Adults With Atten-
tion Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder
(CHADD) (www.chadd.org) might
provide some behavioral supports.
Many young children with ADHD might
still require medication to achieve
maximum improvement, and medica-
tion is not contraindicated for children
4 through 5 years of age. However, only
1 multisite study has carefully as-
sessed medication use in preschool-
aged children. Other considerations in
the recommendation about treating
children 4 to 5 years of age with stim-
ulant medications include:
●The study was limited to preschool-
aged children who had moderate-
to-severe dysfunction.
●Research has found that a number
of young children (4–5 years of age)
experience improvements in symp-
toms with behavior therapy alone.
●There are concerns about the possi-

ble effects on growth during this
rapid growth period of preschool-
aged children.
●There has been limited information
about and experience with the ef-
fects of stimulant medication in chil-
dren between the ages of 4 and 5
years.
Here, the criteria for enrollment (and,
therefore, medication use) included
measures of severity that distin-
guished treated children from the
larger group of preschool-aged chil-
dren with ADHD. Thus, before initiating
medications, the physician should as-
sess the severity of the child’s ADHD.
Given
current
data,
only
those
preschool-aged children with ADHD
who have moderate-to-severe dysfunc-
tion should be considered for medica-
tion. Criteria for this level of severity,
based on the multisite-study results,57
are (1) symptoms that have persisted
for at least 9 months, (2) dysfunction
that is manifested in both the home
and other settings such as preschool
or child care, and (3) dysfunction that
has not responded adequately to be-
havior therapy. The decision to con-
sider initiating medication at this age
depends in part on the clinician’s as-
sessment of the estimated develop-
mental impairment, safety risks, or
consequences for school or social par-
ticipation that could ensue if medica-
tions are not initiated. It is often helpful
to consult with a mental health special-
ist who has had speciﬁc experience
with preschool-aged children if possible.
Dextroamphetamine is the only medi-
cation approved by the FDA for use in
children younger than 6 years of age.
This approval, however, was based on
less stringent criteria in force when
the medication was approved rather
than on empirical evidence of its safety
and efﬁcacy in this age group. Most of
the evidence for the safety and efﬁcacy
of treating preschool-aged children
with stimulant medications has been
from methylphenidate.57 Methylpheni-
date evidence consists of 1 multisite
study of 165 children and 10 other
smaller single-site studies that in-
cluded from 11 to 59 children (total of
269 children); 7 of the 10 single-site
studies found signiﬁcant efﬁcacy. It
must be noted that although there is
moderate evidence that methylpheni-
date
is
safe
and
efﬁcacious
in
preschool-aged children, its use in this
age group remains off-label. Although
the use of dextroamphetamine is on-
label, the insufﬁcient evidence for its
safety and efﬁcacy in this age group
does not make it possible to recom-
mend at this time.
If children do not experience adequate
symptom improvement with behavior
therapy,
medication
can
be
pre-
scribed, as described previously. Evi-
dence suggests that the rate of metab-
olizing stimulant medication is slower
in children 4 through 5 years of age, so
they should be given a lower dose to
start, and the dose can be increased in
smaller increments. Maximum doses
have not been adequately studied.57
Special Circumstances: Adolescents
As noted previously, before beginning
medication treatment for adolescents
with newly diagnosed ADHD, clinicians
should assess these patients for symp-
toms of substance abuse. When sub-
stance use is identiﬁed, assessment
when off the abusive substances
should precede treatment for ADHD
(see the Task Force on Mental Health
report7). Diversion of ADHD medication
(use for other than its intended med-
ical purposes) is also a special con-
cern among adolescents58; clinicians
should
monitor
symptoms
and
prescription-reﬁll requests for signs
of misuse or diversion of ADHD med-
ication and consider prescribing
medications with no abuse potential,
such as atomoxetine (Strattera [Ely
Lilly
Co,
Indianapolis,
IN])
and
extended-release guanfacine (Intu-
niv [Shire US Inc, Wayne, PA]) or
extended-release clonidine (Kapvay
[Shionogi Inc, Florham Park, NJ])
(which are not stimulants) or stimu-
lant medications with less abuse po-
tential, such as lisdexamfetamine
(Vyvanse [Shire US Inc]), dermal
methylphenidate (Daytrana [Noven
Therapeutics, LLC, Miami, FL]), or
OROS
methylphenidate
(Concerta
[Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ti-
tusville, NJ]). Because lisdexamfet-
amine is dextroamphetamine, which
contains an additional lysine mole-
cule, it is only activated after inges-
tion, when it is metabolized by eryth-
rocyte cells to dexamphetamine. The
other preparations make extraction
of the stimulant medication more
difﬁcult.
Given the inherent risks of driving by
adolescents with ADHD, special con-
cern should be taken to provide med-
ication coverage for symptom con-
trol while driving. Longer-acting or
late-afternoon, short-acting medica-
tions
might
be
helpful
in
this
regard.59
Special Circumstances: Inattention or
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem
Level)
Medication is not appropriate for chil-
dren whose symptoms do not meet
DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of ADHD,
although behavior therapy does not re-
quire a speciﬁc diagnosis, and many of
the efﬁcacy studies have included chil-
dren without speciﬁc mental behav-
ioral disorders.
Behavior Therapy
Behavior therapy represents a broad
set of speciﬁc interventions that have a
common goal of modifying the physical
and social environment to alter or
change behavior. Behavior therapy
usually is implemented by training
parents in speciﬁc techniques that im-
prove their abilities to modify and

Downloaded from 
shape their child’s behavior and to im-
prove the child’s ability to regulate his
or her own behavior. The training in-
volves techniques to more effectively
provide rewards when their child dem-
onstrates the desired behavior (eg,
positive reinforcement), learn what
behaviors can be reduced or elimi-
nated by using planned ignoring as an
active strategy (or using praising and
ignoring in combination), or provide
appropriate consequences or punish-
ments when their child fails to meet
the goals (eg, punishment). There is a
need to consistently apply rewards
and
consequences
as
tasks
are
achieved and then to gradually in-
crease the expectations for each task
as they are mastered to shape behav-
iors.
Although
behavior
therapy
shares a set of principles, individual
programs introduce different tech-
niques and strategies to achieve the
same ends.
Table 1 lists the major behavioral in-
tervention approaches that have been
demonstrated to be evidence based
for the management of ADHD in 3 dif-
ferent types of settings. The table is
based on 22 studies, each completed
between 1997 and 2006.
Evidence for the effectiveness of be-
havior therapy in children with ADHD is
derived from a variety of studies60–62
and an Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality review.5 The di-
versity of interventions and outcome
measures makes meta-analysis of
the effects of behavior therapy alone
or in association with medications
challenging. The long-term positive
effects of behavior therapy have yet
to be determined. Ongoing adher-
ence to a behavior program might be
important; therefore, implementing
a chronic care model for child health
might contribute to the long-term
effects.63
Study results have indicated positive
effects of behavior therapy when com-
bined with medications. Most studies
that compared behavior therapy to
stimulants found a much stronger ef-
fect on ADHD core symptoms from
stimulants than from behavior ther-
apy. The MTA study found that com-
bined treatment (behavior therapy
and stimulant medication) was not sig-
niﬁcantly more efﬁcacious than treat-
ment with medication alone for the
core symptoms of ADHD after correc-
tion for multiple tests in the primary
analysis.64 However, a secondary anal-
ysis of a combined measure of parent
and teacher ratings of ADHD symp-
toms revealed a signiﬁcant advantage
for the combination with a small effect
size of d  0.26.65 However, the same
study also found that the combined
treatment compared with medication
alonedidoffergreaterimprovementson
academic and conduct measures when
ADHD coexisted with anxiety and when
childrenlivedinlowsocioeconomicenvi-
ronments. In addition, parents and
teachers of children who were receiving
combined therapy were signiﬁcantly
more satisﬁed with the treatment plan.
Finally, the combination of medication
management and behavior therapy al-
lowed for the use of lower dosages of
stimulants, which possibly reduced the
risk of adverse effects.66
School Programming and Supports
Behavior therapy programs coordinat-
ing efforts at school as well as home
might enhance the effects. School pro-
grams can provide classroom adapta-
tions, such as preferred seating, mod-
iﬁed work assignments, and test
modiﬁcations (to the location at which
it is administered and time allotted for
taking the test), as well as behavior
plans as part of a 504 Rehabilitation
Act Plan or special education Individu-
alized Education Program (IEP) under

Interventions focused on peer

alone or concurrently with behavioral parent
training and/or medication
Ofﬁce-based interventions have produced minimal effects;
interventions have been of questionable social validity;
some studies of BPI combined with clinic-based BPT
found positive effects on parent ratings of ADHD
symptoms; no differences on social functioning or
parent ratings of social behavior have been revealed

means that they have less of an effect. The effect sizes found are considered moderate.

Disability Education Act (IDEA).67 It is
helpful for clinicians to be aware of the
eligibility criteria in their state and
school district to advise families of
their options. Youths documented to
have ADHD can also get permission to
take college-readiness tests in an un-
timed manner by following appropri-
ate documentation guidelines.68
The effect of coexisting conditions on
ADHD treatment is variable. In some
cases, treatment of the ADHD resolves
the coexisting condition. For example,
treatment of ADHD might resolve oppo-
sitional deﬁant disorder or anxiety.68
However, sometimes the co-occurring
condition might require treatment
that is in addition to the treatment for
ADHD. Some coexisting conditions can
be treated in the primary care setting,
but others will require referral and co-
management with a subspecialist.
Action statement 6: Primary care
clinicians should titrate doses of
medication for ADHD to achieve
maximum beneﬁt with minimum ad-
verse effects (quality of evidence
B/strong recommendation).
Evidence Proﬁle
●Aggregate evidence quality: B.
●Beneﬁts: The optimal dose of medica-
tion is required to reduce core symp-
toms to or as close to the levels of chil-
dren without ADHD.
●Harms/risks/costs: Higher levels of
medication increase the chances of ad-
verse effects.
●Beneﬁts-harms assessment: The im-
portance of adequately treating ADHD out-
weighs the risk of adverse effects.
●Value judgments: The committee mem-
bers included the effects of untreated
ADHD when deciding to make this
recommendation.
●Role of patient preferences: The fam-
ilies’ preferences and comfort need to
be taken into consideration in develop-
ing a titration plan.
●Exclusions: None.
●Intentional vagueness: None.
●Strength: strong recommendation.
The ﬁndings from the MTA study sug-
gested that more than 70% of children
and youth with ADHD respond to one of
the stimulant medications at an opti-
mal dose when a systematic trial is
used.65 Children in the MTA who were
treated in the community with care as
usual from whomever they chose or to
whom they had access received lower
doses of stimulants with less frequent
monitoring and had less optimal re-
sults.65 Because stimulants might pro-
duce positive but suboptimal effects at
a low dose in some children and youth,
titration to maximum doses that con-
trol symptoms without adverse effects
is recommended instead of titration
strictly on a milligram-per-kilogram
basis.
Education of parents is an important
component in the chronic illness
model to ensure their cooperation in
efforts to reach appropriate titration
(remembering that the parents them-
selves might be challenged signiﬁ-
cantly by ADHD).69,70 The primary care
clinician should alert parents and chil-
dren that changing medication dose
and occasionally changing a medica-
tion might be necessary for optimal
medication management, that the pro-
cess might require a few months to
achieve optimal success, and that
medication efﬁcacy should be system-
atically monitored at regular intervals.
Because stimulant medication effects
are seen immediately, trials of different
doses of stimulants can be accom-
plished in a relatively short time period.
Stimulant medications can be effectively
titrated on a 3- to 7-day basis.65
It is important to note that by the 3-year
follow-up of 14-month MTA interventions
(optimalmedicationsmanagement,opti-
mal behavioral management, the combi-
nation of the 2, or community treat-
ment), all differences among the initial 4
groupswerenolongerpresent.Afterthe
initial 14-month intervention, the chil-
dren no longer received the careful
monthly monitoring provided by the
study and went back to receiving care
from their community providers. Their
medications and doses varied, and a
number of them were no longer taking
medication. In children still on medica-
tion, the growth deceleration was only
seen for the ﬁrst 2 years and was in the
range of 1 to 2 cm.
CONCLUSION
Evidence continues to be fairly clear
with regard to the legitimacy of the
diagnosis of ADHD and the appro-
priate diagnostic criteria and proce-
dures required to establish a diagno-
sis, identify co-occurring conditions,
and treat effectively with both behav-
ioral and pharmacologic interven-
tions. However, the steps required to
sustain appropriate treatments and
achieve
successful
long-term
out-
comes still remain a challenge. To pro-
vide more detailed information about
how the recommendations of this
guideline can be accomplished, a more
detailed but less strongly evidence-
based algorithm is provided as a com-
panion article.

11349483,True,True,"ADHD continues to be one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and is recognized increasingly as a common psychiatric disorder in adults. Diagnosis of the disorder requires careful consideration of other psychiatric and medical disorders that may mimic symptoms of ADHD. Comorbid disorders are common in patients with ADHD and require careful attention. A recommended diagnostic evaluation for children and adults includes the completion of a psychiatric interview, rating scales from multiple informants, and often individually tailored psychologic testing. Pharmacologic treatment options include the first-line stimulant agents for adults and children and TCAs and atypical antidepressants as second-line agents. Behavioral interventions may help reduce ADHD symptoms and address comorbid conditions in children. Future research is needed to identify the optimal psychosocial treatment for adults with ADHD.","ADVANCES IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most com- 
mon childhood psychiatric disorder and probably one of the most com- 
mon undiagnosed psychiatric disorders in adults. ADHD always begins 
in childhood and may be followed by a lifelong expression o
f
 symptoms, 
including inattention, excessive motor hyperactivity or restlessness, and 
poor impulse control. Standard measures exist for evaluating the disor- 
der and assessing treatment effects. Children and adults are highly 
responsive to pharmacotherapy and may benefit from behavioral and 
psychosocial interventions. 
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
The symptoms of ADHD, including situationally excessive hyperac- 
tivity, impulsivity, and inattention, have concerned physicians for more 
than a century. The German physician Hoffman wrote a poem entitled 
""Fidgety Phil"" in 1865 about a mischievous boy with behavior that 
sounds no different from the complaints parents and teachers voice 
today about children with ADHD. Still"" is credited with presenting the

first systematic clinical studies of ADHD in 1902. He described affected 
children as having a major ”defect in moral control” with ”defective” 
volitional inhibition. Today, these children would be diagnosed as having 
ADHD along with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. 
The long history of interest in ADHD has been accompanied by 
numerous changes in the disorder’s label, reflecting the evolving per- 
spectives of the researchers studying the disorder. These frequent 
changes have been a source of confusion to parents, educators, and 
health care professionals. Labels for the disorder have included minimal 
brain dysfunction, hyperkinetic impulse disorder, and in the 1980s labels 
with attention deficit included to reflect an emphasis on attentional dys- 
function. Although the current label of ADHD includes a tten 
tion-deficit, 
more recent models o
f
 ADHD are less likely to focus on attention deficits 
because of less evidence for broad deficiencies in attention. Current 
theories instead focus on neurobehavioral dysfunction in inhibition, 
working memory, and processes subsumed under executive functions.8, 
9, 
25 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The frequency o
f
 ADHD in children in various epidemiologic stud- 
ies ranges from 2% to 10% and higher. The consensus among experts in 
the field places the incidence at 3% to 5y0.~ 
This substantial variance in 
findings is related to several methodologic differences involving diag- 
nostic procedures, age of informants, and differential inclusion of all 
subtypes. The definition of ADHD itself has been changed in the various 
editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual o
f
 Mental Disorders (DSM). 
Some have questioned whether ADHD is a cultural phenomenon in 
the United States. Studies in several other countries have shown signifi- 
cant rates of ADHD, however, including studies in New Zealand? 3

Puerto R~CO,’~ 
India,14 and Germany.28 
There is a significant 
predominance of ADHD in boys. This ratio is found to be higher in 
clinic populations with ranges o
f
 2:l to lO:l, with a ratio of 6:l most 
commonly 
In nonreferred samples, the ratio ranges from 2.5:l to 
5.1:l with an approximate average of 3.4:1.”, 76 
The rate of occurrence of ADHD in adults has become a subject of 
increasing interest. The incidence of ADHD in adults has been estimated 
using prevalence rates in adult samples and by ascertaining the rate of 
persistence of ADHD in children as they grow into adulthood. There is 
significant variability in the findings of these studies. The methodology 
in these studies also varies, similar to the studies of children. One 
published study estimated the prevalence o
f
 ADHD in adults at 4.7Y0.~~ 
Several studies have followed ADHD children into adulthood. The rates 
of ADHD diagnosis and symptoms found in the follow-up sample of 
the adults are highly discrepant from one another (e.g., ranges from 
4% to 66%).48, 
49, 8o Methodologic differences across studies, including 
switching informants from the parent to the child and differing defini- 
ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYEF&4CTIVITY 
DISORDER

tions of ADHD and of remission criteria between studies, may be respon- 
sible for the conflicting rates o
f
 ADHD found in the follow-up samples. 
Another question relates to the increasing number of people pre- 
senting to clinics for evaluation o
f
 possible adult ADHD. In an attempt 
to study the question of how many of these people actually have a 
diagnosis of ADHD, Roy-Byrne et aP6 
studied 143 consecutive subjects 
presenting to an ADHD specialty clinic. After a comprehensive evalua- 
tion, 32% clearly met diagnostic criteria; 32% clearly did not meet crite- 
ria; and 36% exhibited current ADHD-like features but did not meet 
diagnostic criteria, either because o
f
 a lack of a childhood history of 
ADHD symptoms or because of complicating severe psychiatric or sub- 
stance abuse comorbidity. 
It is not surprising given the varying numbers just outlined that 
overall prevalence rates of ADHD in adults usually are reported to 
range from 10% to 60?'0.~~, 
38, 48, 49, 
Overall estimates indicate that one 
third to two thirds of ADHD children continue to manifest at least some 
significant symptoms of ADHD into adulthood. Working estimates o
f
 
adult ADHD prevalence based on these studies and extrapolations from 
child data yield a rate of 1% 
to 6% of the adult population, with an 
average rate of 2% often ~ i t e d . ' ~ , ~ ~  
CLINICAL FEATURES 
ADHD is characterized by persistent inattention or situationally 
excessive motor activity (or both) and impulsive behavior."" According 
to the current DSM; individuals must exhibit symptoms for at least 6 
months and express the symptoms by 7 years of age. The degree o
f
 the 
symptoms must be developmentally inappropriate and exhibited in at 
least two settings. There are three subtypes of ADHD: (1) 
predominantly 
inattentive (ADHD-I), (2) predominantly hyperactive/impulsive 
(ADHD-HI), and (3) combined type (ADHD-C). 
Diagnosis for each sub- 
type depends on the number of criteria met by the patient from the 
DSM-IV three symptom lists, inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, 
found under the ADHD criteria (Table 1). 
Patients who exhibit primarily 
inattentive symptoms are given the diagnosis of ADHD-I; patients who 
exhibit primarily hyperactive and impulsive symptoms are given the 
diagnosis of ADHD-HI; and patients who exhibit a combination of 
symptoms are given the diagnosis of ADHD-C. 
There is controversy regarding the DSM-IV criteria and subtyping. 
There are concerns that the ADHD-I patients may not belong under the 
same category of the other ADHD types because they may not possess 
the same type of attentional deficits found in the other subtypes. There 
are some doubts that ADHD-HI is separate from ADHD-C, but rather 
that it is an earlier developmental stage of ADHD-C. Additional debate 
arises in regard to the appropriateness of applying some of the school- 
age-worded DSM-IV ADHD symptoms to adolescents and adults pre- 
senting for diagnosis.

CLINICAL EVALUATION 
Many professionals may play a role in the evaluation and treatment 
of ADHD. In the case of school-age patients, the teacher can be an 
extremely important source of information, which may include direct 
history and rating scale data. A teacher has several advantages as a 
historian, including seeing the patient in the attention-demanding envi- 
ronment of the classroom and having the patient's classmates as ready 
comparison subjects at the same developmental level. A veteran teacher 
has developed a good sense of what is normal for that particular age 
and developmental level. A school counselor can provide additional 
school information, including information on additional academic re- 
sources for the student. Counselors can help to coordinate information 
exchange between teachers and clinicians. Psychologists can provide 
comprehensive evaluations and psychologic testing. Psychologists also 
can provide all nonpharmacologic 
modes of treatment. Psychiatrists can 
provide evaluations outside of psychometric testing and can provide a 
full range of treatment. Primary care physicians can provide medical 
evaluations, coordinate medical tests, and provide ongoing medication 
management. Neurologists can provide specialized neurologic evalua- 
tions when indicated and can provide medication management. 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
Several psychiatric disorders can present with symptoms similar to 
ADHD. Depressive disorders such as major depression and dysthymia 
can present with poor concentration and attention. There are prominent 
mood symptoms and neurovegetative symptoms in these disorders as 
well, however, symptoms that would not be expected in ADHD. As is 
the case in differentiating many Psychiatric conditions from ADHD, 
these symptoms usually will have begun more recently than the early 
childhood onset that is necessary for the diagnosis of ADHD. Bipolar 
disorder and cyclothymia can present with hyperactivity, poor attention, 
and increased distraction. There also are other mood symptoms present. 
The differentiation 
of severe ADHD from early-onset bipolar disorder is 
a challenging diagnostic task that is currently the center of some contro- 
versy. The depressed moods that can be part of ADHD without comorbid 
depression are not accompanied by anhedonia, and the ups are character- 
ized by excitement and not euphoria.81 
Anxiety disorders may present with problems with attention and 
may be accompanied by increased motor activity. Obsessive-compulsive 
disorder can cause distractibility, but with careful history taking the 
presence of obsessions and compulsions usually can be elicited. The 
possible presence of alcohol or substance abuse needs to be assessed. 
Certain personality disorders, especially borderline personality disorder, 
can present with affective lability, impulsivity, and periods of increased 
762 
SCHWEITZER et a1 
activity. These periods usually are more prolonged than in ADHD, 
however,8l and often are related to environmental stress. 
Learning disorders can present with academic difficulties 
and subse- 
quent demoralization, which can lead to tuning out in the classroom. 
Learning disorders can be identified through cognitive and academic 
testing. This testing reveals a substantial discrepancy (usually defined 
as >1.5 SD) between overall cognitive ability and achievement scores in 
one or more specific academic domains, such as math or reading. Learn- 
ing disorders frequently are comorbid with ADHD, as are many of the 
other psychiatric disorders mentioned here. 
In older patients, dementia must be considered. The time course 
of symptom onset is much different. Other considerations include a 
discrepancy between ability and classroom placement or between aca- 
demic expectations and actual abilities. Stress can impair attention and 
concentration but usually in a more acute and episodic manner. 
Many medical conditions can present with symptoms similar to 
ADHD. Thyroid dysfunction can impair attention and alter activity level. 
Hypoglycemia may present with ADHD-like symptoms. Other medical 
disorders to be considered include long-term illnesses involving the 
kidney or liver, past head injury, central nervous system disease, and 
seizure disorders (especially petit ma1 epilepsy).77 
Sleep disorders, in- 
cluding sleep apnea, have been reported in patients previously diag- 
nosed with ADHD.95 
Human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) 
encephalop- 
athy has been reported to present with ADHD-like symptoms in 20% to 
40% o
f
 cases4 Other central nervous system diseases that affect the 
frontal lobes can produce symptoms similar to ADHD. 
In conducting a medical evaluation of a patient with possible 
ADHD, a thorough medical history, family medical history, and physical 
examination are warranted. No medical tests are indicated universally, 
but basic screening laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count, 
kidney functions, liver functions, and thyroid functions, are reasonable. 
Other tests, such as electroencephalography, neuroimaging, or a sleep 
study, are indicated only if initial medical screening suggests an indi- 
cation for these tests. A urine drug screen or serial screens are indi- 
cated i
f
 substance abuse is suspected. If the history is not consistent 
with ADHD, a more rigorous pursuit of other possible causes probably 
is wise. 
Consideration of other disorders is important in the evaluation of 
ADHD. As mentioned previously, many psychiatric disorders can be 
comorbid with ADHD. In children, learning disorders, communication 
disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder often are 
comorbid as are mood and anxiety disorders.6, 
16,

rates o
f
 anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance abuse, and antiso- 
cial personality disorder have been notedl7,

Recognition and treatment of these comorbid disorders is crucial for a 
positive overall treatment outcome.

PSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW 
A significant amount of clinically relevant information typically is 
obtained in advance of the clinical interview, including relevant school 
records and copies of any previous psychologic evaluations. Packets 
containing developmental and family history forms, health and medica- 
tion history forms, and behavior rating scales are mailed to the patient 
and completed before the interview. 
The clinical interview usually is conducted with the patient and a 
responsible informant (e.g., husband with spouse, child with parents). 
The interview begins with a discussion of the reason for referral and the 
effect of these difficulties on the patient’s daily life. The interviewer 
proceeds to review the completed history forms, placing particular em- 
phasis on early childhood temperament as well as behavioral or sleep 
problems that may have preceded the current concerns. Attempts are 
made to explore family problems and stressful life events that might 
have had an impact on the referred family member. 
A synopsis of the patient’s academic history incorporates open- 
ended questions about the impression the child has made on his or her 
teachers as well as on peers. The clinician remains particularly alert at 
this time to red pugs indicative of learning difficulties or behavioral 
problems that have intensified as academic demands increased; although 
young students often can compensate for symptoms of ADHD in un- 
structured classroom settings, signs of problems can emerge simultane- 
ously with the presentation of academic material that requires seatwork. 
When the patient is an adult, the academic history is supplemented 
by copies of transcripts and standardized test scores. Extracurricular 
activities and social-emotional functioning, including use o
f
 leisure time 
and the ability to maintain close relationships, are reviewed. Subsequent 
questions are directed toward employment, handling of personal fi- 
nances, driving records, and current or past legal difficulties, all of which 
can be affected by long-standing symptoms of ADHD. Adolescent or 
adult problems with substance abuse are addressed in conjunction with 
the medical and psychiatric history. 
Finally, semistructured questions based on DSM-IV criteria are 
asked to provide further documentation regarding diagnosis. Efforts are 
made to obtain examples o
f
 each symptom under discussion to deter- 
mine whether, in the opinion of the clinician, the behavior is of clinical 
significance. It is important to verify whether the patient’s difficulties 
emerged before the age of 10 or 12 and whether the difficulties have 
affected the patient’s functioning in at least two of three settings (e.g., 
home, school, work). 
RATING SCALES 
Use of self-report and observer rating scales as one component of 
an ADHD evaluation provides the professional with an inexpensive and 
764 
SCHWEITZER et a1 
time-efficient assessment tool. Developed with statistical rigor and the 
intention of creating short but reliable measures, rating scales allow the 
clinician to assess behaviors that often are suppressed in the unfamiliar 
context of the clinical setting. Rating scales.provide an opportunity to 
evaluate the patient's symptoms according to the degree to which they 
deviate statistically from commonly accepted behaviors (e.g., established 
group norms)."" 
Self-report rating scales allow the patient to document his or her 
personal experience o
f
 problematic behaviors in diverse settings and 
according to their relative impact. Similarly, scales completed by signifi- 
cant others who play important roles in the life of the patient provide a 
means of quantifymg the patient's (qualitative) 
observations. Both types 
of rating scales are subject to rater error, however, including uninten- 
tional exclusion of important information and positive or negative 
bias."", 23 Appraisal of information according to the clinician's judgment 
of the informant's reliability is required. Results of rating scales depend 
on confirmation of the data across multiple sources (e.g., test results, 
behavioral observations during the evaluation). In short, although they 
are effective, valid, and treatment sensitive, rating scales cannot be relied 
on in the absence of other diagnostic measures. 
Rating scales selected for an ADHD evaluation should include at 
least one instrument that assesses a broad spectrum of psychopathologic 
conditions, including depression, anxiety, and aggressive behavior."" The 
Behavioral Assessment for Children'j2 
is a scale that serves this purpose 
for younger patients. In the case of adults, the Symptom Checklist 
90-RevisedZ6 
is widely used as a screening tool for comorbidity. 
Many rating scales include symptoms specific to a diagnosis of 
ADHD. These scales vary, however, according to their relative focus, the 
targeted age range, and the degree to which they adhere to DSM-IV 
criteria. The Child Behavior Checklist,3"" the Conners' Rating Scales: 
Revised Child and Adolescent 
and the Cross-Informant Version 
of the Youth Self-Reportz 
provide parent as well as teacher forms; the 
Cross-Informant 
measure allows direct comparison of youth, parent, and 
teacher reports.

The Barkley and Murphy 
measure, which can be found in their clinical workbook published 
in 1998,11a includes a form designed to assess patient (and parents') 
recollections of problematic behaviors between the ages of 5 and 12, a 
crucial variable in making a diagnosis. 
PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING 
No standard battery of tests currently exists for diagnosing ADHD, 
and it has not been shown that individuals with ADHD produce distinc- 
ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HEl7ACTIVI'IY DISORDER 
765 
tive profiles on commonly used neuropsychologic meas~res.4~ 
Given the 
problems inherent in diagnosing this heterogeneous disorder as well as 
the absence of a gold standard for the diagnosis,"" the procedure pre- 
ferred by many clinicians is the administration of a comprehensive 
psychologic battery. The selected battery must consist of statistically 
valid, reliable tests that have shown practicality in terms of time and 
ease of administration as well as good predictive uti1ity.l' The battery 
should be modified as needed to address the specific needs of each pa- 
tient. 
A comprehensive evaluation generally begins with the administra- 
tion of an intelligence test.78, 
79 Although these measures consume sig- 
nificant time (e.g., typically 1.5 to 1 2  
hours), they provide the clinician 
with an immediate estimate of the patient's verbal and nonverbal skills. 
Of particular importance, intelligence quotient test scores provide a 
yardstick against which other test results can be measured. 
The next phase of the evaluation comprises individually adminis- 
tered achievement tests. Given that the ADHD patient often complains 
of poor academic performance, it is possible that several or all of the 
scores obtained would be lower than the patient's estimated potential 
(e.g., full-scale IQ). In this instance, the clinician attempts to identify the 
factors contributing to any discrepancies during the remaining portions 
of the battery. Low achievement test scores can be attributed to a learning 
disability (e.g., inability to process auditory or visual information cor- 
rectly), problems with inattention or hyperactivity, social-emotional 
con- 
cerns, or a combination of these as well as other  variable^.^^ 
Language skills are assessed through measures of receptive and 
expressive vocabulary, including structured writing and naming tasks. 
The Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-111), which comprises 
several subtests that evaluate adult auditory and visual memory skills, 
is likely to be included; similar measures are available for children. 
Visual construction and visual memory can be measured further by 
administration of the Rey-O~terreith~~ 
as well as other tests that require 
fine motor control or hand-eye coordination and figural memory. 
Tests of attention and executive functioning typically assess the 
ability of the examinee to sh$ his or her perceptual or auditory set to 
conform to changing task demands; these measures may require the 
suppression of a habitual response in favor of an unusual one. The 
Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) is considered a particu- 
larly effective means of measuring sustained attention and cognitive 
flexibility, and it has been found useful in detecting subtle deficits in 
neurocognitive functioning.'l, 
35 
The most popular and widely studied means of measuring sus- 
tained attention and impulse control is based on the prototype of the 
continuous performance test.21 
These measures require the examinee to 
observe a screen for a specific period of time, usually 10 to 15 minutes, 
while stimuli (e.g., letters or numbers) are projected at varying intervals; 
the examinee is instructed to press (or not press) a button after the 
appearance of a given stimulus. 
766 
SCHWEITZER et a1 
Every comprehensive test battery should contain statistically reliable 
measures o
f
 social-emotional functioning. These include the behavior 
rating scales already described as well as self-report measures for chil- 
dren, adolescents, and adults. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory-2nd Edition (MMPI-2) is a self-report measure that often is 
used to assess a broad range of psychopathologic  condition^.^^ Self- 
report tests that address specific emotional problems, such as depression 
and anxiety, often are added to the battery. Although they are not 
considered statistically valid, a sentence completion task as well as other 
projective tests may be selected if the clinician wishes to access more 
subtle psychologic problems, such as a thought disorder. 
The administration of a comprehensive battery permits the clinician 
to observe the patient's behavior under stress and as the patient re- 
sponds to a variety o
f
 task demands. These observations in themselves 
can contribute a significant amount of information and weigh heavily 
when conclusions are reached regarding diagnosis and treatment. 
TREATMENT 
The National Institutes of Health Consensus Panel released a state- 
ment in November 199858 
to provide information regarding effective 
treatments for ADHD. The panel concluded that stimulants were more 
effective than psychosocial therapies alone in treating the symptoms of 
ADHD. It was emphasized, however, that because few studies examined 
the status of core symptoms 
beyond 14 months of treatment, longer term 
research investigating 
the relative effectiveness 
of medication, behavioral 
interventions, and their combination was warranted. It was agreed that 
it was not possible at that time to issue specific recommendations 
regard- 
ing the long-term outcome of treatment options. This article presents the 
current state-of-the-art treatment recommendations for pharmacologic 
and behavioral interventions. 
Pharmacologic 
Treatment 
Stimulants 
In children, the first-line pharmacologic therapy for ADHD remains 
stimulants, 
which have been shown to be effective in approximately 70% 
of patients in more than 140 different controlled trials.69 
Second-line 
agents include the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which have shown 
moderate to robust responses in more than 25 studies in children and 
 adolescent^.^^ A significant concern has arisen over the sudden unex- 
plained deaths of four ADHD children treated with desipramine,l al- 
though whether any causal link between desipramine and these deaths 
exists is uncertain.'j8 
The atypical antidepressant bupropion generally is 
considered to be a second-line treatment agent and has been shown to

be effective in one large controlled multisite study in children. The a2- 
noradrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine are used in children. A 
few clinical studies have shown beneficial responses in behavior.37* 
40-42, 72 
Whether there is significant cognitive benefit with a agonists is less 
clear.37, 
4042, 
72 Reports of deaths in several children taking clonidine in 
conjunction with other medications including stimulants have led to 
concern about the cardiovascular safety of the stimulant and a-agonist 
combination of medications. Many confounding circumstances exist in 
these cases of sudden death, however.29, 
In adults, there is less compelling evidence supporting the efficacy 
o
f
 stimulants, and more debate exists about what medications should be 
used to treat ADHD in adults. There are only 2 open and 10 controlled 
trials of stimulants in adults* showing therapeutic response in 25% to 
78% of cases. Several factors appear to contribute to this wide range of 
response rates. The studies varied significantly in their diagnostic 
criteria 
used for ADHD, assessment of a positive response, and medication 
doses used; also, many subjects had significant comorbid conditions. 
Long-term outcome studies are generally lacking, although one study 
showed sustained response to methylphenidate in 117 patients during 6 
months.8s 
There has been a general trend showing better response rates 
with meth~lphenidate~~, 
51* 
71* 83, 94 as compared with pem~line.~~, 
92 Only 
one controlled trial has shown efficacy for dextroamphetamine in adult 
ADHD.59 
Evidence from a more recent study of stimulants in adults suggests 
that one reason that response rates in earlier adult studies may have 
been low was due to inadequate dosing. This study used a more robust 
dose of methylphenidate (and more stringent and specific ADHD diag- 
nostic criteria) of approximately 1 mg/kg/d and showed the highest 
response rate of 78Y0.~' 
This higher dose range is similar to that used in 
the child studies previously mentioned. 
Dosing recommendations"", l3 as summarized in Table 2 reflect this

higher dose range. Common side effects of all the stimulants include 
appetite suppression, sleep disturbance, digestive upset, abdominal dis- 
comfort, and mild increases in heart rate and blood pressure. The emer- 
gence o
f
 tics, which may be permanent, is another potential side effect. 
Other less common but notable side effects include dysphoria, depres- 
sion, anxiety, and, in children, rare toxic psychosis. Most of the less 
serious side effects usually are transient, although more severe side 
effects may necessitate discontinuation of the medication. It appears 
prudent to monitor pulse, blood pressure, and weight at the initiation 
o
f
 treatment and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. A major concern with 
pemoline is the development of clinically significant hepatitis in 3% of 
ADHD children. As of 1995, there had been 1
1
 deaths resulting from 
acute hepatic failure in the 20 years since the introduction of pem01ine.~~ 
This concern has led to the relabeling of pemoline as a second-line agent 
for the treatment of ADHD. Hepatic function tests should be performed 
every 6 months with pemoline, but no other monitoring laboratory tests 
are required for the stimulants in general. 
Tricyclic Antidepressants 
Only two adult studies,s9, 
90 one of which was ~ontrolled,8~ 
have 
shown TCAs to be effective in adult ADHD. This study showed a 68% 
response rate and showed continuing improvement for 6 weeks, similar 
to an antidepressant response. Most o
f
 the responders required doses of 
150 mg/d or greater, although a few responded at doses of less than 100 
mg/d. 
TCAs usually are initiated at a dose of 25 mg per day with the dose 
usually taken at bedtime. They can be titrated to a maximum dose of 
250 mg/d or 150 mg/d for nortriptyline, which is twice as potent as the 
other TCAs. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, 
sedation, blurred vision, weight gain, and possible sexual side effects. 
Most of these side effects are minor and transient. Cardiac side effects 
may include delayed cardiac conduction, increased heart rate and blood 
pressure, and orthostatic hypotension. These side effects usually are not 
clinically significant and do not interfere with ongoing treatment."" 
Possible advantages in the use of TCAs include the fact that 30% to 
50% of adults do not respond to stimulants or are unable to tolerate 
them because of side effects or exacerbation of comorbid  condition^.'^, 
67, 90 Other advantages of TCAs include negligible abuse liability, once- 
per-day dosing, efficacy in anxiety and depression, and apparent lack of 
exacerbation of tics.17 
, 
Vital signs should be monitored before TCA treatment and every 3 
to 6 months thereafter. An electrocardiogram before initiating treatment 
and after a therapeutic dose is achieved and premedication and yearly 
complete blood count and blood chemistries are not indicated absolutely 
but appear prudent.

Other Antidepressants 
Bupropion was studied in one open trial o
f
 adults with ADHD and 
was found to be effective in 14 of 19 subjects, with 8 showing marked 
improvement during 6 to 8 weeks.s2 
This study used doses of 50 to 150 
mg 3 times a day. In general, bupropion treatment is started at 37.5 to 
75 mg daily and titrated to 150 mg 3 times a day. Individual doses 
should not exceed 150 mg and should be spaced 6 hours apart. A 
sustained-release form of bupropion is available, which may be started 
at 100 to 150 mg daily and increased to 100 to 200 mg 2 times a day 
with doses given at least 8 hours apart. Side effects of bupropion include 
an increased risk of seizures in patients with a history of seizures or 
bulimia. This risk is dose dependent and increases significantly at doses 
greater than 450 mg/d. Other side effects include excitement, agitation, 
insomnia, and tremor. Rash and tics have been reported in children. 
Advantages of bupropion include its benign cardiac profile and antide- 
pressant efficacy. Bupropion also presents significantly less risk of seda- 
tion than the TCAs. There is no specific vital sign or laboratory monitor- 
ing indicated with bupropion administration. 
Venlafaxine has been studied in three open trials involving 41 adult 
subjects and was found to produce measurable reduction o
f
 ADHD 
symptoms in 75% of subjects who tolerated the medication. There was 
a significant rate of drug discontinuation because of side effects, how- 
ever. Many of these patients also were taking stimulants during these 
studies. Venlafaxine usually is started at 25 mg/d and titrated to a usual 
dose of 150 to 225 mg/d. Venlafaxine is given in twice-a-day dosing, 
but similar to bupropion an extended-release form of the drug is avail- 
able that can be taken once a day. Side effects include nausea, gastroin- 
testinal distress, dry mouth, blurred vision, sweating, and increased 
blood pressure at higher doses. A significantly unpleasant but not medi- 
cally dangerous withdrawal syndrome has been reported with abrupt 
discontinuation. Monitoring of venlafaxine should include blood pres- 
sure monitoring, especially at higher doses. 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported 
to be beneficial in two small open studies of children and adoles- 
cents.12,33 
In both studies, the SSRI was used in addition to methylpheni- 
date, however, and in at least one study one of the criteria used for 
clinical improvement was depression. The authors are not aware of any 
controlled studies in adults with ADHD. A consensus statement of 
expert opinion on ADHD treatment did not support the usefulness of 
the SSRIs in ADHD treatment.57 
At present, the SSRIs are not recom- 
mended in the treatment of ADHD itself. They may be useful, however, 
in the treatment of comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders. 
Other Agents

about dietary interactions possibly producing hypertensive crises and 
significant drug-drug interactions make these drugs a less than ideal 
choice for ADHD patients.

previously but have not been studied in any controlled way in adults. 
f3-Blockers have been studied in one open study at high doses with 
some evidence o
f
 symptomatic benefit.50 
Two new agents have been studied in small double-blind, placebo- 
controlled trials and shown to reduce ADHD symptoms in adults in 
these trials. These agents include the nicotinic agonist ABT-4M91 
and the 
highly selective experimental 
noradrenergic antidepressant tam~xetine.~"" 
Measurement of Treatment 
Effects 
There should be regular assessment of the therapeutic effects and 
side effects of all the medications administered. ADHD rating scales 
should be completed by parents, teachers, adult patients, and their 
significant others two to three times before the medication is initiated. 
The premedication ratings reduce the effects of rater bias and produce a 
more valid assessment of treatment effects. Parents are encouraged to 
start a stimulant regimen with children on a weekend so that they will 
have the opportunity to observe the effects during the full time course 
of the stimulant medications. Teachers often are superior in rating the 
efficacy of stimulants, however, whereas parents are better at rating side 
effects.74 
The ADHD Indexz is a quick scale for teachers and parents to 
assess stimulant efficacy. The Side Effect Rating Scale for Stimulants7 
can 
be given to assess side effects. Swanson et a174 
have developed a useful, 
brief teacher phone interview for further assessing medication efficacy in 
ADHD. Rating scales and teacher phone interviews should be completed 
weekly during the medication titration period. Rating scales and inter- 
views completed by spouses and coworkers can assist in assessing 
treatment effects in adults. Once the initial dosing schedule is complete, 
physicians should continue monthly medication reviews with parents 
and adult patients. 
Summary 
Despite the lack of compelling efficacy data similar to that seen in 
children, the stimulants appear to remain the first-line treatment for 
ADHD in adults. More .positive efficacy studies support this treatment 
strategy, as does extrapolation of pediatric data. The TCAs and atypical 
antidepressants are valuable second-line agents. They may be preferable 
first-line choices in certain patients, including patients with active or 
recent substance abuse and patients with significant comorbid anxiety 
and depression. Newer experimental agents hold promise as potential 
additional treatment options for the future. Further studies are needed 
ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY 
DISORDER 
771 
to clarify and support further these treatment strategies as well as to 
study further their long-term effects. 
Behavioral Interventions 
Although the evidence for the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments 
for ADHD has strong empirical support (i.e., MTA54), 
there also is a role 
for behavioral interventions in the treatment of the disorder. Behavioral 
interventions are necessary for the 20% to 30% o
f
 patients who do not 
respond to stimulantsll and for patients who experience significant side 
effects from pharmacologic agents. These interventions can address co- 
morbidity (e.g., anxiety, MTA55). 
Combining behavioral treatment with 
medication management may permit the use of lower doses of medica- 
tion, although this awaits confirmation from a large-scale study. 
Behavioral interventions for children with ADHD have been studied 
for more than 25 years, and there is sufficient empirical support for the 
application of specific techniques, such as behavioral parent training and 
behavioral classroom interventions.60 
There are sufficient data to show 
that cognitive therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (e.g., self-in- 
struction, self-monitoring, self-reinforcement, and self-directed problem 
solving) do not have empirical support for the treatment of ADHD.60 
The major distinction between the behavioral-based and cognitive-based 
strategies is in the implementation of contingency management interven- 
tions in the behavioral strategies. These contingency management inter- 
ventions include the delivery of consequences by a parent, teacher, or 
paraprofessional for the child's behavior. There is a paucity of empiri- 
cally tested behavioral or psychosocial treatments for adults with 
ADHD; it is likely, however, that behavioral treatments also would work 
for adults. 
Parent and School Interventions 
Parent training programs typically are conducted on an individual 
or group basis. Programs typically span 6 to 12 consecutive weekly 
sessions in a clinic setting. Sessions often begin with an educational 
component reviewing causes of defiant behavior and general knowledge 
of ADHD and proceed to teach basic behavioral techniques, including 
giving effective commands, the establishment of reward programs for 
appropriate behavior, response cost, and time-out.l0 Adolescence is a 
particularly difficult time for children with ADHD, and behavioral pro- 
grams have been developed to address specifically training families of 
the ADHD adolescent.'l, 63, 64 Parents of younger children and adolescents 
often are encouraged to implement daily report card programs as a mecha- 
nism for parents to deliver consequences at home based on behavior 
exhibited at school. The daily reports foster communication between 
parents and teachers and provide parents with a glimpse of how their 
child is performing in a more socially demanding environment.

School-based interventions are recognized as an important part of 
any behavioral intervention. The 1990s produced an unprecedented rec- 
ognition o
f
 the need for appropriate interventions implemented within 
the school setting. Although the U.S. Department of Education now 
recognizes that a student with ADHD may qualify for special services 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the services offered 
by an individual school may vary greatly depending on the school 
system. Some schools and teachers make accommodations for students 
with ADHD and support the use of classroom interventions, whereas 
others offer greater resistance and require active pressure from parents 
and treatment providers before agreeing to implement school interven- 
tions. 
Interventions for Adults With Attention- 
De 
ficit'ffyperactivity 
Disorder 
Most adults with ADHD require assistance with organizational 
management and interpersonal relationships. Similar to children with 
ADHD, behavioral interventions can be applied, using developmentally 
appropriate reward systems for performing desired behavior. Adults can 
be taught to identify reasonable goals for the work and home setting, 
trained to record their success in achieving goals, then to have rewards 
delivered by themselves or significant others on completion of a targeted 
goal. An important component of behavioral interventions for adults 
includes the implementation of a time-management program in which 
adults learn to plan and organize short-term and long-term goals. Adults 
are taught to make environmental accommodations, such as posting 
visual cues on a large calendar above the desk or carrying a tape- 
recorder to meetings and writing notes based on a tape-recorded tran- 
script. 
Many adults with ADHD encounter interpersonal difficulties with 
spouses, children, friends, and coworkers. Social skills training in a 
group setting and marital and family therapy may address many of the 
interpersonal issues. Individual psychotherapy is indicated for patients 
who may experience depressive or anxious symptoms secondary to 
ADHD or comorbid with ADHD. Many adults express poor self-esteem 
secondary to a lifelong 
battle with the primary ADHD symptoms. 
Adults 
with ADHD often look to the popular press for information and treat- 
ment recommendations for their disorder. The widely available informa- 
tion in the popular self-help books for adults with ADHD tends to vary 
greatly in how well grounded its theories and recommendations are 
in data. 
College students with ADHD may require special treatment consid- 
erations. Equipped with psychologic test results and a diagnosis, college 
students may qualify for special accommodations in the college setting. 
Typical accommodations for college students may include extended test- 
taking time, note takers, test administration in a room with fewer stu- 
dents, or rooming in a quieter dormitory. There is a great degree of 
ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HERACTIVITY DISORDER 
773 
variability in the accommodations offered by different colleges, and 
parents and prospective college students should be encouraged to con- 
tact the student disability office to determine the quality and breadth of 
services available at each college under consideration. In sum, there is 
sufficient evidence to indicate that behavioral interventions in children 
are helpful in reducing ADHD symptoms and in addressing comorbid 
symptoms. Future studies should begin to identify the most efficacious 
psychosocial interventions for adults. 
SUMMARY 
ADHD continues to be one of the most common psychiatric disor- 
ders in children and is recognized increasingly as a common psychiatric 
disorder in adults. Diagnosis of the disorder requires careful consider- 
ation of other psychiatric and medical disorders that may mimic symp- 
toms of ADHD. Comorbid disorders are common in patients with 
ADHD and require careful attention. A recommended diagnostic evalua- 
tion for children and adults includes the completion of a psychiatric 
interview, rating scales from multiple informants, and often individually 
tailored psychologic testing. Pharmacologic treatment options include 
the first-line stimulant agents for adults and children and TCAs and 
atypical antidepressants as second-line agents. Behavioral interventions 
may help reduce ADHD symptoms and address comorbid conditions in 
children. Future research is needed to identify the optimal psychosocial 
treatment for adults with ADHD.

11548968,True,True,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is widely theorized to stem from dysfunctional inhibitory processes. However, the definition of inhibition is imprecisely distinguished across theories. To clarify the evidence for this conception, the author relies on a heuristic distinction between inhibition that is under executive control and inhibition that is under motivational control (anxiety or fear). It is argued that ADHD is unlikely to be due to a motivational inhibitory control deficit, although suggestions are made for additional studies that could overturn that conclusion. Evidence for a deficit in an executive motor inhibition process for the ADHD combined type is more compelling but is not equally strong for all forms of executive inhibitory control. Remaining issues include specificity to ADHD, whether inhibitory problems are primary or secondary in causing ADHD, role of comorbid anxiety and conduct disorder, and functional deficits in the inattentive ADHD subtype.",
11563573,True,True,"Symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are present in as many as 9 percent of school-age children. ADHD-specific questionnaires can help determine whether children meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The recommended evaluation also includes documenting the type and severity of ADHD symptoms, verifying the presence of normal vision and hearing, screening for comorbid psychologic conditions, reviewing the child's developmental history and school performance, and applying objective measures of cognitive function. The stimulants methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine remain the pharmacologic agents of first choice for the management of ADHD. These agents are equally effective in improving the core symptoms of the disorder, but individual children may respond better to one stimulant medication than to another. Achievement of maximal benefit may require titration of the initial dosage and dosing before breakfast, before lunch and in the afternoon. The family physician should tailor the treatment plan to meet the unique needs of the child and family. Psychosocial, behavioral and educational strategies that enhance specific behaviors may improve educational and social functioning in the child with ADHD.",

Given the lack of reviews that consolidate and compare worldwide prevalence of depression among adolescents, this review aims to examine the global prevalence of major depressive disorders, dysthymia, and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents.",
28645024,True,True,"Depression prevalence in older adults varies largely across studies, which probably reflects methodological rather than true differences.

ABSTRACT 
Background 
Depression prevalence in older adults varies largely across studies, which probably reflects 
methodological rather than true differences. This study aims to explore whether and to what 
extent the prevalence of depression varies when using different diagnostic criteria and rating 
scales, and various samples of older adults. 
Methods 
A population-based sample of 3353 individuals aged 60-104 years from the Swedish National 
Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) were examined in 2001-2004. Point 
prevalence of depression was estimated by: 1) diagnostic criteria, ICD-10 and DSM-IV-
TR/DSM-5; 2) rating scales, MADRS and GDS-15; and 3) self-report. Depression prevalence 
in sub-samples by dementia status, living place, and socio-demographics were compared.   
Results 
The prevalence of any depression (including all severity grades) was 4.2% (moderate/severe: 
1.6%) for ICD-10 and 9.3% (major: 2.1%) for DSM-IV-TR; 10.6% for MADRS and 9.2% for 
GDS-15; and 9.1% for self-report. Depression prevalence was lower in the dementia-free 
sample as compared to the total population. Furthermore, having poor physical function, or 
not having a partner were independently associated with higher depression prevalence, across 
most of the depression definitions.  
Limitations 
The response rate was 73.3% and this may have resulted in an underestimation of depression. 
Conclusion 
Depression prevalence was similar across all depression definitions except for ICD-10, 
showing much lower figures. However, independent of the definition used, depression 
prevalence varies greatly by dementia status, physical functioning, and marital status. These 
findings may be useful for clinicians when assessing depression in older adults and for 
researchers when exploring and comparing depression prevalence across studies.

INTRODUCTION 
Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders and a common cause of disability 
and reduced life-satisfaction in old age (Skoog, 2011). Along with the worldwide increase in 
the number of older adults (Christensen et al., 2009), a better understanding of depression in 
old age is highly valuable from clinical and public health perspectives. 
Several studies have examined the prevalence of depression in older adults. However, 
prevalence estimates from previous studies are inconsistent and range between 1% and 16% 
for major depression, 2% to 19% for minor depression, and 7.2% to 49% for depressive 
symptoms in older adults living in the community or in nursing homes (Djernes, 2006). It is 
likely that the differences in depression prevalence may be due to methodological 
discrepancies, e.g. different definitions used to identify depression and differences in the 
populations studied (Luppa et al., 2012, Beekman et al., 1999). Yet, a scarce number of 
population-based studies have simultaneously used different depression definitions 
(diagnostic criteria, rating scales, and self-report), and sub-samples of the study population 
(e.g., by dementia status, living place, and socio-demographics) to verify to what extent 
depression prevalence may differ (Luppa et al., 2012).  
This study aims to explore whether and to what extent the point prevalence of depression 
varies in older adults aged 60-104 years when using different diagnostic criteria (ICD-10 and 
DSM-IV-TR/DSM-5), rating scales (MADRS and GDS-15), and self-report, and in sub-
samples by dementia status, living place, and socio-demographics.  
 
 
METHODS 
Study population  
This study used data from the population-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in 
Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) (Lagergren et al., 2004). The representative sample was randomly 
selected from 11 age-cohorts (60, 66, 72, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, and 99+ years) of 
residents in the district of Kungsholmen in Stockholm, Sweden. The eligible sample included 
4590 individuals (Santoni et al., 2015). Of these, 3363 participated (73.3%) in the baseline 
examination in 2001-2004. Informed and written consent have been collected directly from 
each participant or, in the case of cognitive impairment, from a proxy (e.g. a close family 
member). The Regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm has approved all phases of the 
SNAC-K study. 
Of the 3363 participants, 10 did not undergo physical examination, leaving 3353 individuals 
in the analyses. To examine depression in a dementia-free sample an additional 311 
individuals were excluded. To examine a community-dwelling sample, 191 individuals who 
lived in an institution were excluded. Therefore, the prevalence of depression was presented 
for the total population (N=3353, including those with dementia and living in institutions), 
and in two sub-samples: a dementia-free sample (N=3042, excluding those with dementia), 
and community-dwelling sample (N=3162, excluding those living in institutions). 
 
Data collection 
During the baseline examinations comprehensive information were collected through clinical 
examinations, interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and cognitive tests administered 
by nurses, physicians, and psychologists.  
 
Assesment of depression 
Assessment of depressive symptoms 
Experienced physicians carried out a general medical examination where the Comprehensive 
Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) was used to assess the point prevalence of 
depression at the time of the examination. The CPRS is a semi-structured instrument used to 
assess current psychiatric signs and symptoms (Åsberg et al., 1978) and includes ratings of 
each sign or symptom based on its intensity, frequency, and duration. Each item of the CPRS 
is rated from 0 to 6, with a rating of 2 indicating the presence of a symptom, and higher 
ratings indicating more severe symptoms. The CPRS has been proven to have good 
applicability and reliability in older adults (van der Laan et al., 2005).  
 
Diagnosis of depression 
Specific items from the CPRS were selected to represent depressive symptoms according to 
an experienced psychiatrist and researcher, and cut-off levels for when a symptom was 
considered as present varied between 2 and 4 (see Appendix 1). This algorithm was done in 
accordance with a previous study (Skoog et al., 1993). The assessment was further supported 
by the examining physician’s clinical judgment and by information from the self-reported 
questionnaires on depressive symptoms. A physician reviewed and independently diagnosed 
depression according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
classification of mental and behavioural disorders: diagnostic criteria for research (World 
Health Organization (WHO), 1993) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 4th Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 
(APA), 2000), and 5th Edition  (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association (APA), 2013) 
(see Appendix 2). The ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research requires the presence of 4 out 
of 10 specified symptoms of which at least 2 of the 3 following core symptoms have to be 
present for a mild depression: low mood, loss of interest, and decreased energy. A moderate 
depression requires a total of 6 symptoms, in which 2 of the 3 core symptoms have to be 
present. A severe depression requires a total of 8 symptoms, in which all of the 3 core 
symptoms have to be present. Minor depression was diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR requiring 2 
to 4 symptoms, with at least 1 of the 2 core symptoms of low mood and loss of interest 
present. Major depression diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 requires a total of 5 out of 
the 9 specified symptoms, and the presence of at least 1 of the 2 core symptoms (Karlsson et 
al., 2016) (see Appendix 2).  
  
Depressive symptoms by rating scales 
Depressive symptoms were also rated according to the following rating scales: the 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale 
(GDS-15 short form). MADRS is a subscale of CPRS that includes 10 items for the rating of 
depressive symptoms (see Appendix 2) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979). The MADRS-score 
ranges from 0 to 60 and the cut-off for depression was categorized as >9 (Zimmerman et al., 
2004). MADRS has been validated among older adults and showed no difference in 
sensitivity and specificity across the different age groups (<80 or >80 years old) (Mottram et 
al., 2000). MADRS has also been shown to have high inter-rater reliability (ranging from 0.89 
to 0.97) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979), and a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.81 
when compared to diagnostic criteria in a sample of cognitively impaired individuals using 
the cut-off >9 (Knapskog et al., 2011). GDS-15 consists of 15 items with a yes/no answer (see 
Appendix 2). The GDS is specifically designed to rate depressive symptoms in adults aged 65 
years and older (Sheikh and Yesavage, 1986). The inter-rater reliability for GDS-15 has been 
found to be high (0.94). The accuracy of the scale has also been shown not to differ across 
sociodemographic characteristics, health status or cognitive functioning (Marc et al., 2008). In 
the current study, 10 of the items included in GDS-15 were assessed from the self-reported 
questionnaires and 5 from the CPRS. Each answer indicating depression was given a score of 
1. The overall score ranges from 0 to 15 and the cut-off used for depression was ≥5, since this 
cut-off has previously been shown to have the highest sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.95), 
as well as the best trade-off between them when compared to diagnostic criteria according to 
DSM-IV (Marc et al., 2008, Nyunt et al., 2009).  
 
Self-reported depression 
Self-reported depression was assessed by the examining physicians asking whether the 
participants were currently suffering from depression. The answers were categorized as 
yes/no.    
In this study, any depression refers to individuals fulfilling the criteria for minor or major 
depression according to DSM-IV-TR/DSM-5; mild, moderate, or severe depression according 
to ICD-10; a cut-off score of >9 on MADRS; ≥5 on GDS-15; or answering yes to the question 
on self-reported depression. 
  
Diagnosis of dementia 
The clinical diagnosis of dementia was made according to the DSM-IV criteria following a 3-
step procedure. First, preliminary diagnoses were made independently by the examining 
physician, followed by second diagnoses by a reviewing physician. In case of disagreement 
between the first and the second diagnoses a third opinion was requested (Fratiglioni et al., 
1992). Dementia cases were defined as having definite or questionable dementia.  
 
Socio-demographic and health-related variables  
Age was categorized into four categories: 60-66, 72-78, 81-87, and 90-104 years. Education 
was dichotomized as compulsory education (9 years of schooling) or less versus more than 
compulsory education. Marital status was classified as not having a partner 
(unmarried/widowed/divorced) versus having a partner (married/having a partner but do not 
live together); living place as community-dwellings versus in institutions; and physical 
function as having dependency in one or more of the ADL (activities of daily living) items 
bathing/showering, dressing, hygiene, transfer, and eating versus no dependency. MMSE 
scores were divided into three groups (0-23, 24-26, and 27-30) to describe cognitive function 
(Folstein et al., 1975). 
 
Medication 
The use of antidepressants was assessed during the medical examination and classified 
according to the international classification system “Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
Classification” (ATC) (WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology and 
Norweigan Institute of Public Health, 2010). The antidepressants with the ATC-code ‘N06A’ 
were included in this study, and were dichotomized as use of any antidepressant versus no 
use. 
 
Statistical analyses 
Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the association of socio-demographic and 
health-related characteristics (independent variables) with depression (dependent variable). To 
examine depression prevalence in different sub-samples, analyses were further stratified by 
dementia status, living place, and socio-demographics. All statistical tests were two-tailed and 
a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were carried out 
using SPSS 22.  
 
Multiple imputations of missing data were conducted using a random number generator 
program with 40 imputations. Age, education, sex, marital status, diagnosis of dementia, 
living place, use of antidepressants, physical function, cognitive function, diagnosis of any 
depression, and self-reported depression, were taken into account when imputing missing 
data.  
The imputation was conducted for 170 individuals who had missing data on depression 
according to ICD-10, 148 individuals who had missing data on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5, 284 
individuals who had missing data on any of the 10 items of MADRS, 1226 individuals who 
had missing data on any of the 15 items of GDS-15, and 119 individuals who had missing 
data on self-reported depression. Imputation was also done for 32 individuals who had 
missing data on education, 10 individuals on physical dependency (ADL), 15 individuals on 
marital status, 5 individuals on use of antidepressants, and 6 individuals on cognitive function 
(MMSE scores).  
 
RESULTS 
The characteristics of the study population is presented in Table 1. 
The prevalence of depression according to the various depression definitions are presented in 
Table 2. The prevalence of any depression ranged between 4.2% and 9.3% according to the 
diagnostic criteria; 9.2% to 10.6% for the rating scales; and was 9.1% for self-report. Overall, 
689 individuals (21%) were identified by at least one depression definition (data not shown).  
  
Since major depression according to DSM-5 is the same as DSM- IV-TR, DSM-5 is only 
presented in Table 2. 
 
Regardless of the depression definition used, except for self-report, the prevalence of any 
depression was significantly lower in the samples that excluded individuals with dementia, 
and those living in institutions, as compared to the total population (Figure 1).  
Overall, when examining the age-specific prevalence of depression by a 10-year age interval, 
it was lowest in the youngest and increased with age, independently of the depression 
definition used (Table 3). Being a woman was also significantly associated with a higher 
prevalence of depression (data not shown).  
Having dementia, being physically dependent, or not having a partner were independently 
associated with a higher prevalence of depression. However,  no significant differences were 
observed between marital status and GDS-15- and self-reported depression, and physical 
function and GDS-15 depression. In addition, being older (81-104 years) was independently 
associated with GDS-15 depression, being a woman with self-reported depression, and living 
in an institution with DSM-IV-TR depression (Table 4). There was no multicollinearity 
between the independent variables. 
In addition, around 34% of those with any ICD-10 depression and 30% of those with any 
DSM-IV-TR depression were taking antidepressants (data not shown).  
DISCUSSION 
In this urban population of adults aged 60-104 years, we found that the prevalence of any 
depression (including all severity grades) was 4.2% (moderate/severe:1.6%) for ICD-10 and 
9.3% (major: 2.1%) for DSM-IV-TR; 10.6% for MADRS and 9.2% for GDS-15; and 9.1% 
for self-report. Depression was lower in the dementia-free sample (2.1% to 7.8%) as 
compared to the total population (4.2% to 10.6%). Furthermore, having poor physical function 
(adjusted OR: 2.4 to 3.2) or not having a partner (adjusted OR: 1.9 to 2.1) were independently 
associated with a higher depression prevalence across most of the depression definitions.  
According to the diagnostic criteria, the prevalence of moderate/severe and major depression 
diagnosed with ICD-10 (1.6%), and DSM-IV-TR/DSM-5 (2.1%), in our study, were in line 
with some previous population-based studies on older adults (Beekman et al., 1995, Wilhelm 
et al., 2003). However, it was lower than those reported in most other studies (Ohayon and 
Hong, 2006, Park et al., 2010, Steffens et al., 2000, Marengoni et al., 2009, Wiberg et al., 
2013, Forlani et al., 2014). Our findings of milder forms of depression according to ICD-10 
(2.7%) and DSM-IV-TR (7.1%) were also lower than those found in earlier studies (Forlani et 
al., 2014, Paivarinta et al., 1999), but similar to two population-based studies (Lyness et al., 
1999, Newman et al., 1998). When compared to the studies that reported higher prevalence, 
some of these populations had lower levels of education and/or cognitive function than our 
population (Park et al., 2010, Forlani et al., 2014). Both of these characteristics have been 
associated with late-life depression (Djernes, 2006). Thus, possibly partly explaining the 
lower diagnostic depression prevalence in our study. In addition, our urban population may 
have had good access to health-care and better provision of depression treatment, thus 
resulting in lower depression prevalence. 
The depression prevalence based on the rating scales (MADRS: 10.6% and GDS-15: 9.2%), 
in our study, were also observed in other population-based studies (Wang et al., 2010, Regan 
et al., 2013), although some studies reported a higher prevalence (Murata et al., 2008, van't 
Veer-Tazelaar et al., 2008, Abe et al., 2012, Wild et al., 2012). Overall, it is difficult to 
compare the prevalence across population-based studies since different rating scales and cut-
offs have been used. The most commonly used rating scales to assess the prevalence of 
depressive symptoms in old age are the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 
(CES-D) (Radloff, 1977) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (15 or 30 items) (Yesavage et al., 
1982). We were not able to assess depressive symptoms using CES-D. However, the validity 
of GDS-15 has been shown to be similar to CES-D (Wancata et al., 2006). When comparing 
the characteristics of the rating scales used in our study, each of the 15 items included in 
GDS-15 are presented dichotomously (yes/no) and the numbers of fulfilled symptoms are 
summed. In contrast, each of the 10 items included in MADRS are rated on an ordinal scale 
(ranging from 0 to 6) and the scores for all of the items are summed. However, in comparison 
to the diagnostic criteria, all of the symptoms in GDS-15 and MADRS are equally weighted, 
while in DSM-IV-TR/ICD-10 specific core symptoms must present to fulfill the definition of 
any depression. 
We found that the prevalence of any depression was similar across all depression definitions 
(9.1 to 10.6%) except for ICD-10, which was lower (4.2%). This finding was expected since 
more symptoms are needed to fulfill the criteria for mild depression according to ICD-10 (at 
least 4), than for minor depression with DSM-IV-TR (at least 2). However, the prevalence of 
more severe forms of depression were fairly similar according to ICD-10 (moderate/severe: 
1.6%) and DSM-IV-TR (major: 2.1%).  
Our findings that the prevalence of depression was lower in the sample that excluded 
individuals with dementia, as compared to the total population, have been similarly 
demonstrated in other studies (Forsell and Winblad, 1998, Bergdahl et al., 2011). Yet, most 
population-based studies excluded individuals with dementia or cognitive impairment from 
the study population, or if included, they did not separately report depression prevalence for 
individuals with and without dementia. It may be difficult to obtain diagnoses of depression in 
individuals with dementia due to their cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, to exclude 
individuals with dementia on studies of depression may disregard people with the worst 
prognosis, because both of the syndromes are related to adverse health outcomes. There are 
specific scales to overcome the issue of assessing depression in individuals with dementia e.g. 
the Cornell Scale for depression in dementia (Alexopoulos et al., 1988). Although we were 
not able to use this scale in our study, both GDS-15 and MADRS have been validated in 
individuals with different cognitive status and it was found not to be influenced by cognitive 
impairment (Marc et al., 2008, Knapskog et al., 2011). 
Few epidemiological studies have simultaneously reported the prevalence of depression 
among individuals living in institutions and in the community. Our findings that depression 
prevalence was lower when excluding individuals living in institutions are supported by a 
meta-analysis (Xiu-Ying et al., 2012). However, when we controlled for other factors such as 
socio-demographics, dementia status and physical functioning, the association was no longer 
significant except for depression diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR. This may be due to a lack of 
power since there were only 191 individuals who were living in an institution in our 
population. Still, our results highlight the importance of considering living place when 
examining the prevalence of depression in older adults to provide a complete picture of the 
general population. In addition, given the worldwide phenomenon of an aging population, the 
demand for institution- and nursing home care is expected to increase (World Health 
Organization (WHO) and National Institute on Aging US Department of Health and Human 
Services, 2011). Thus, it is highly relevant to further explore and identify possible modifying 
mechanisms and effective prevention strategies among those living in institutions. 
We found that not having a partner and poor physical functioning were independently 
associated with depression across most of the depression definitions, these results are 
supported by previous studies (Djernes, 2006, Skoog, 2011). Several studies have shown the 
importance of social support in relation to depression (Blazer, 2003), and the association 
between marital status and depression may partly be explained by the social support that a 
marriage may give. In addition, older individuals tend to be more concerned about the ability 
to be physically independent than physical diseases per se, and physical functioning is very 
important for the quality of life for older individuals (Donoghue et al., 2014). This may 
explain the independent association between physical functioning and depression. It is 
important to bear in mind that the association between social support or physical dependency 
and depression may be bi-directional, e.g. lack of social support and physical dependency 
may be a consequence of depression and vice versa (Greenglass et al., 2006). 
Furthermore, we found that the prevalence of depression was lowest in the youngest old (60-
66) and increased with age, independent of the severity of depression or the depression 
definition used. Some studies have reported a decrease (Beekman et al., 1999) or no change 
(Steffens et al., 2000) of major/severe depression with age, while most have reported an 
increase of depressive symptoms with age (Luppa et al., 2012, Skoog, 2011). However, a 
meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression increased for those aged 55-90 years, 
but not after the age of 90 years old (Zhao et al., 2012). It has been suggested that the increase 
of depression with age may be explained by socio-demographics, functional ability, and 
health-related problems (Djernes, 2006, Blazer, 2003). This is partly supported by our results 
since the higher depression prevalence with age vanished when we controlled for other socio-
demographic and health-related factors. However, the majority of previous population-based 
studies did not examine depression with the wide age range as used in our study (60-104 
years).  
Our finding that depression prevalence was significantly higher in women than men is in line 
with studies on depression worldwide (Skoog, 2011, Beekman et al., 1999). However, when 
we controlled for other socio-demographic and health-related factors the significant 
association disappeared, which was similarly observed in a previous study (Alvarado et al., 
2007). Yet, there was still a significant sex difference in self-reported depression after 
controlling for the other factors. This may be partly due to men being more likely to withhold 
emotional expressions of depression because of sex stereotypes (e.g. depression may partly be 
perceived as feminine and contradicting to societal ideals of masculinity) (Martin et al., 
2013).  
It is noteworthy that only one-third of those diagnosed with any ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR 
depression were taking antidepressants. This is comparable with most previous population-
based studies (Djernes, 2006). This under treatment may be due to under detection, which is 
supported by previous studies in primary health care settings (Volkers et al., 2004, Conwell, 
1997).  
 
 
 
Strengths and limitations 
Major strengths of this study are the ability to provide depression prevalence based on several 
different definitions of depression, the large population-based sample with a wide age range 
(60-104 years old), and the use of experienced physicians to perform the examinations.  
Some limitations need to be addressed. First, even though our response rate was 73.3%, we 
cannot exclude the possibility of participation bias since individuals with depression are less 
likely to participate in population-based studies. This may have led to an underestimation of 
depression prevalence. Second, the missing data were not missed completely at random; those 
with missing data were more often in a disadvantageous situation (e.g. had lower education, 
more physical disabilities, and were more often without a partner etc.). As expected, the 
depression prevalence increased after the imputation and was closer to the prevalence 
reported in previous studies than the observed figures, supporting our decision for imputation. 
In addition, we used an automatic statistical imputation method that has been recommended 
for dealing with data not missing at random. Still, it is important to bear in mind that the 
imputed depression prevalence never can replace the reality. Third, a consequence of 
imputing data is that the number of individuals is not always exactly the same across the 
tables and figures. However, this did not influence the main results or conclusion. Fourth, we 
did not have the possibility to use the original GDS-15 questionnaire, which may have led to 
biased estimations. Nevertheless, a physician and a researcher carefully matched the 15 items 
with the available questionnaire, and confirmed with a senior researcher and another 
physician. In addition, after imputation the results were similar to those found in other studies 
using the original GDS-15 questionnaire.  
 
 
 
Conclusion  
In an urban population of older adults aged 60-104 years, we found that the prevalence of any 
depression was similar across all definitions of depression except for ICD-10, showing much 
lower figures. However, independent of the depression definition used, prevalence varies 
greatly by dementia status, physical functioning, and marital status. These findings may be 
useful for clinicians when assessing depression in older adults, and for researchers when 
exploring and comparing depression prevalence across studies.

Highlights 
 We explored whether and to what extent the prevalence of depression varies when 
using different diagnostic criteria and rating scales, and in sub-samples by dementia 
status, living place, and socio-demographics in adults aged 60-104 years. 
 The point prevalence of any depression was similar across all definitions except for 
ICD-10, showing much lower figures. 
 Depression prevalence was lower in the dementia-free sample as compared to the total 
population. 
 Having poor physical function or not having a partner were independently associated 
with a higher prevalence of depression.

OBJECTIVE — To estimate the odds and prevalence of clinically relevant depression in adults
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Depression is associated with hyperglycemia and an increased risk
for diabetic complications; relief of depression is associated with improved glycemic control. A
more accurate estimate of depression prevalence than what is currently available is needed to
gauge the potential impact of depression management in diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases and
published references were used to identify studies that reported the prevalence of depression in
diabetes. Prevalence was calculated as an aggregate mean weighted by the combined number of
subjects in the included studies. We used x2 statistics and odds ratios (ORs) to assess the rate and
likelihood of depression as a function of type of diabetes, sex, subject source, depression assess-
ment method, and study design.
RESULTS — A total of 42 eligible studies were identiﬁed; 20 (48%) included a nondiabetic
comparison group. In the controlled studies, the odds of depression in the diabetic group were
twice that of the nondiabetic comparison group (OR 5 2.0, 95% CI 1.8–2.2) and did not differ
by sex, type of diabetes, subject source, or assessment method. The prevalence of comorbid
depression was signiﬁcantly higher in diabetic women (28%) than in diabetic men (18%), in
uncontrolled (30%) than in controlled studies (21%), in clinical (32%) than in community
(20%) samples, and when assessed by self-report questionnaires (31%) than by standardized
diagnostic interviews (11%).
CONCLUSIONS — The presence of diabetes doubles the odds of comorbid depression.
Prevalence estimates are affected by several clinical and methodological variables that do not
affect the stability of the ORs.

ecent meta-analyses link depres-
sion in diabetes with hyperglycemia
(1) and with an increased risk for
complications of the metabolic disorder
(2). There is also evidence from three con-
trolled trials to suggest that treatment of
depression improves glycemic control
(3–5). An accurate estimate of depression
prevalence is needed to help gauge the
potential impact of depression manage-
ment in patients with comorbid diabetes.
Gavard et al. (6) last reviewed studies of
the prevalence of depression in diabetes
in 1993. Since then, the literature on this
subject has expanded considerably. In
the present study, we comprehensively
reviewed the scientiﬁc literature to de-
termine the odds of clinically signiﬁcant
depression in those with diabetes ver-
sus those without diabetes and to esti-
mate the aggregate prevalence. These
estimates were also studied in relation to
the type of diabetes, sex, source of sub-
jects, study design, and method of de-
pression assessment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Inclusion/exclusion criteria.
MEDLINE and PsycINFO search engines
were used to identify published studies
that measured the point and/or lifetime
prevalence of depression in adults with
diabetes. The terms depression, depressive
disorder, minor depressive disorder, or dys-
thymic disorder were combined with the
terms diabetes or diabetes mellitus. The
search was limited to studies published
before January 1, 2000. Studies were lim-
ited to those that 1) were published or
available in English, 2) had a sample size
$25, and 3) included only adults ($18
years of age) diagnosed with type 1 or
type 2 diabetes. Reference lists of pub-
lished studies were also examined to ob-
tain additional reports.
The review includes all available
studies that identiﬁed clinically relevant
depression, (i.e., depression severe
enough to warrant clinical intervention).
This deﬁnition includes major depressive
disorder as well as minor and subsyndro-
mal depression. In patients with diabetes
and other chronic medical illnesses, each
of these presentations of depression has
been shown to have adverse effects on so-
cial and physical functioning and quality
of life that are independent of the effects
of the medical illness (7–11). Both major
and minor depressions are associated
with increased medical morbidity and
mortality, even after adjustment for
health status and health behaviors (12–
14). Similarly, there is evidence that ther-
apy to treat these depressive conditions is
effective and associated with improve-
ments in mood, functioning, and quality
of life (15–17).

Procedures and statistical analyses.
Studies meeting the inclusion criteria
were examined, and study demographics
(age, race, sex, and type of diabetes) as well
as depression information (assessment
method, prevalence, and mean scale scores)
were recorded using a structured form
based on the ones used by the Cochrane
Library’s Database of Systematic Reviews,
produced by the Cochrane Collaboration
(18). Two reviewers independently ab-
stracted data from each study. The articles
were divided into subgroups of controlled
and uncontrolled studies. For the pur-
poses of this review, the term controlled
does not imply that the condition under
study (depression) was randomly manip-
ulated or followed longitudinally. A study
was considered controlled if the preva-
lence of depression in diabetic patients
was compared with that of a nondiabetic
comparison group. A study was consid-
ered uncontrolled if it did not have a non-
diabetic comparison group.
Major depressive disorder was as-
sessed with structured or semistructured
diagnostic interviews (e.g., the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule [19] or the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R [20])
and diagnosed according to the criteria
for major depressive disorder speciﬁed in
the version of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (21,22) that
was current at the time of the study. In
these studies, depression prevalence was
equal to the percentage of patients in the
sample who met the criteria for the diag-
nosis.
In some studies, depression was as-
sessed by self-report symptom scales
(e.g., the Beck Depression Inventory
[BDI] [23] or the Center for Epidemio-
logic Studies–Depression Scale [24]). In
these studies, depression prevalence was
equal to the percentage of subjects with
scale scores above a speciﬁed threshold
value. The threshold score used to iden-
tify a depression case varied somewhat
across studies (e.g., BDI score $10 in
some studies [25–27] and $13 [28] or
$16 [29] in others). This variance is to be
expected, since the threshold score used
to identify depression is to some extent
dependent on the importance placed on
depression recognition and the resources
available for this purpose within a partic-
ular clinical setting (30,31).
Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated
only for controlled studies, because these
calculations derive from comparing the
odds of depression in the diabetic group
with the odds in the nondiabetic compar-
ison group. Potential moderator variables
were analyzed to determine whether it
would be necessary to estimate the odds
of depression separately by these vari-
ables. The Breslow-Day test for homoge-
neity was used to determine whether the
likelihood of depression in diabetic ver-
sus nondiabetic patients differed depend-
ing on type of diabetes, sex, source of
subjects, or depression assessment
method. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel sta-
tistics were used to test the signiﬁcance of
the aggregate odds of depression in dia-
betic versus nondiabetic patients after ad-
justing for these variables.
Depression prevalence was calculated
as an aggregate mean, weighted by the
number of subjects in the study or group-
ing of interest (e.g., type 1 vs. type 2 dia-
betes). This method factors study sample
size into the calculation of the overall
prevalence estimate. We used x2 tests to
statistically compare the prevalence of de-
pression in the diabetic and nondiabetic
comparison groups. An overall estimate
of depression prevalence adjusted for po-
tential moderators (e.g., age, sex, and type
and severity of diabetes) could not be cal-
culated with precision because none of
the studies fully characterized the de-
pressed and nondepressed subsets in this
regard.
RESULTS — The literature search
identiﬁed 48 studies, 6 of which were ex-
cluded for having ,25 subjects or having
poorly described or inadequate depres-
sion or diabetes assessment methods. The
42 included studies had a combined sam-
ple size of 21,351 subjects. Of these stud-
ies, 20 (48%) were controlled (i.e.,
included a nondiabetic comparison
group) and 22 (52%) were uncontrolled
(Tables 1 and 2). Of the 20 controlled
studies, 3 (15%) were comprised exclu-
sively of patients with type 1 diabetes; 8
(40%) included only patients with type 2
diabetes; and 9 (45%) included a mixed
sample (i.e., one that contained patients
having either type 1 or type 2 diabetes).
None of the mixed-sample controlled
studies reported depression prevalence
separately by type of diabetes. Of the 22
uncontrolled studies, 6 (27%) were lim-
ited to patients with type 1 diabetes, 5
(23%) to patients with type 2 diabetes,
and 11 (50%) to patients with either type
1 or type 2 diabetes. The majority (6 of 11
[64%]) of the mixed-sample uncontrolled
studies did not report depression preva-
lence separately by type of diabetes. Of
the 42 total studies, 3 (7%) did not pro-
vide enough information to be included
in the OR or point prevalence calcula-
tions. Two of these three studies (32,33)
reported only the statistical comparison
of the mean depression scale scores of di-
abetic versus nondiabetic subjects, and
the other (34) reported only lifetime rates
of depression.
Odds of depression in diabetes
Ten of the controlled studies reported de-
pression estimates separately by type of
diabetes (type 1, n 5 3; type 2, n 5 7).
The odds of depression were signiﬁcantly
increased in both type 1 (OR 5 2.9, 95%
CI 1.6–5.5, x2 5 12.8, P 5 0.0003) and
type 2 diabetes (OR 5 2.9, 95% CI 2.3–
3.7, x2 5 84.3, P , 0.0001) over nondi-
abetic control subjects. The increased
odds of depression associated with diabe-
tes were similar in type 1 versus type 2
diabetes (2.9 vs. 2.9, Breslow-Day x2 5
0.004, P 5 0.95), and the signiﬁcant ef-
fect of diabetes on depression remained
after controlling for type of diabetes
(Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 5 95.5,
P , 0.0001).
Seven controlled studies reported the
prevalence of depression separately for
men and women. The odds of depression
were signiﬁcantly elevated in both
women (OR 5 1.7, 95% CI 1.4–2.0, x2 5
34.0, P , 0.0001) and men (OR 5 1.7,
95% CI 1.4–2.2, x2 5 19.6, P , 0.0001)
with diabetes compared with control sub-
jects. The increased odds of depression
associated with diabetes were similar in
women versus men with diabetes (1.7 vs.
1.7, Breslow-Day x2 5 0.08, P 5 0.8),
and the signiﬁcant effect of diabetes on
depression remained after controlling for
sex (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 5
53.9, P , 0.0001).
The controlled studies were divided
into subsets of community (n 5 11) and
clinical (n 5 7) studies. All of the commu-
nity studies identiﬁed diabetic and non-
diabetic subjects from random samples of
community-dwelling individuals. In the
clinical studies, the diabetic and nondia-
betic subjects were drawn mostly from
nonrandom samples of patients recruited
from health care clinics, patient support
groups, or physician referrals. The odds
of depression were signiﬁcantly increased
in people with diabetes versus those with-

out diabetes in both the community
(OR 5 1.8, 95% CI 1.6–2.1, x2 5 98.6,
P , 0.0001) and the clinical (OR 5 2.1,
95% CI 1.5–2.8, x2 5 19.0, P , 0.0001)
studies. The increased odds associated
with diabetes were similar in the commu-
nity and clinical studies (1.8 vs. 2.1,
Breslow-Day x2 5 0.37, P 5 0.5), and the
signiﬁcant effect of diabetes on depres-
sion remained after controlling for subject
source (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 5
117.6, P , 0.0001).
Seven of the controlled studies used
clinician interviews and psychiatric diag-
nostic criteria to determine depression,
and the other 11 controlled studies used
threshold scores on self-report depression
symptom scales. The pattern of ORs re-
lated to method of depression assessment
was similar to that of type of diabetes, sex,
and subject source (Fig. 1). The odds of
depression were signiﬁcantly elevated in
diabetic patients over control subjects
whether depression was assessed with di-
agnostic interviews or with self-report
scales. There was no signiﬁcant difference
in ORs between methods (Fig. 1), and the
signiﬁcant effect of diabetes on depres-
sion remained after controlling for
method of assessment (Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel x2 5 170.9, P , 0.0001).
Because the incremental increases in
the odds of depression did not differ as a
function of type of diabetes, sex, subject
source, or method of depression assess-
ment, the ﬁndings from all of the con-
trolled studies (n 5 18 studies, 17,399
subjects) were combined to calculate an
aggregate OR. In this combined sample,
the odds of depression were twice as high
in those with diabetes compared with the
control subjects (OR 5 2.0, 95% CI 1.8–
2.2, x2 5 159.8, P , 0.0001).
Prevalence of depression in diabetes
Prevalence estimates were determined by
aggregating data reported in the con-
trolled and uncontrolled studies to capi-
talize on the combined subject pool.
These rates were determined by sex, sub-
ject source, method of depression assess-
ment, and type of diabetes. These unad-
justed prevalence estimates are displayed
in Table 3, and should be viewed cau-
tiously, because they do not adjust for
other factors (e.g., sex, method of depres-
sion assessment, and study design) that
may affect prevalence.
The aggregate estimate of depression
was lower in type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes
(x2 5 11.5, P 5 0.007). However, the
rates for type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes were
statistically similar in the studies that de-
termined depression by diagnostic inter-
view (13.6 vs. 10.9%) or with self-report
scales (29.1 vs. 32.9%) (P . 0.1 for both
comparisons). As would be predicted
from the similar ORs for male and female
subjects, women had an increased preva-
lence of depression in comparison to
men, just as they do in the nondiabetic
population. The combined prevalence
was signiﬁcantly higher in women with
diabetes than in men with diabetes (28.2
vs. 18.0%, x2 5 42.1, P , 0.0001; OR 5
1.6, 95% CI 1.4–1.8). Self-report–based
estimates were higher than interview-
based estimates in both the controlled
(26.1 vs. 9.0%, x2 5 100.6, P , 0.0001)
and uncontrolled studies (34.9 vs. 14.2%,
x2 5 109.2, P , 0.0001) (Fig. 2). Simi-
larly, estimates from the uncontrolled
studies were signiﬁcantly higher than in
controlled studies whether depression
was assessed with diagnostic interviews
(14.2 vs. 9.9%, x2 5 10.3, P 5 0.001) or
with self-report scales (34.9 vs. 26.1%,
x2 5 34.2, P , 0.0001). Major depressive
disorder (per diagnostic interviews) was
present in 11.4% of patients with diabe-
tes; elevations in depressive symptoms
(per self-report scales) were signiﬁcantly
more common and were present in 31.0%
of patients with diabetes (x2 5 159.8, P ,
0.0001).
Of the 42 studies identiﬁed by the
search, 8 (19.0%) determined the lifetime
prevalence of major depression (2 con-
trolled and 6 uncontrolled). Lifetime
prevalence is the proportion of study sub-
jects who met criteria for the disorder at
any point during their life, either before or
during the time of assessment. The life-
time prevalence of depression was signif-
icantly higher in those with diabetes than

in control subjects (17.5 vs. 6.8%, respec-
tively, x2 5 34.2, P , 0.0001). The ag-
gregate estimate of the lifetime prevalence
of major depression based on all eight
studies was 28.5%.
CONCLUSIONS — We estimated
the odds and prevalence of depression in
diabetes from 39 studies having a com-
bined total of 20,218 subjects. The prin-
cipal conclusion of the review is that
diabetes doubles the odds of depression.
The OR of depression is more consistent
across studies than is the prevalence,
which varies by sex, study design, subject
source, and method of depression assess-
ment. The overall OR estimate generalizes
across community and clinical settings
despite differences in prevalence rates be-
tween these settings. Both clinicians and
epidemiologists can expect individuals
with diabetes to be twice as likely to be
depressed than otherwise similar nondia-
betic individuals in similar settings (i.e.,
individuals selected by similar proce-
dures, of the same sex, and assessed with
comparable depression assessment meth-
ods). In contrast, the prevalence estimate
must be adjusted for moderators such as
sex.
Aggregate estimates based on all of
the eligible studies indicate that major de-
pression and elevated depression symp-
toms were present, respectively, in 11 and
31% of individuals with diabetes. The
odds of depression were signiﬁcantly
higher in women than in men with diabe-
tes (OR 5 1.8), a pattern that mirrors the
female preponderance of depression ob-
served in epidemiological surveys of the
general population (35–37). The ﬁndings
are similar to the unadjusted rates re-
ported in other medical illnesses (38–40)
and in an earlier review of the diabetes
literature by Gavard et al. (6) that in-
cluded 18 studies. These investigators
found that major depression was present
in 14.7% and elevated depression symp-
toms in 26% of diabetic patients. Thus, as
many as one in every three individuals
with diabetes (at least in those participat-
ing in clinical studies) has depression at a
level that impairs functioning and quality
of life (7–11), adherence to medical treat-
ment (41–43), and glycemic control (1),
and increases the risk of diabetes compli-
cations (2).
The prevalence of depression varied
systematically as a function of the method
used to identify depression cases and the
study design. Furthermore, in both con-
trolled and uncontrolled studies, the de-
pression rates were approximately two
to three times higher in studies that used
self-report measures versus diagnostic

interviews. It is likely that the two ap-
proaches identify somewhat different but
overlapping samples of depressed indi-
viduals. Diagnostic interviews identify
major depressive disorder but exclude
other clinically relevant presentations.
Self-report measures also identify most
cases of major depressive disorder. In pa-
tients with diabetes, BDI cutoff scores of
$10 and $16 have sensitivities of 0.98
and 0.73, respectively, for major depres-
sive disorder (31). Self-report measures
may identify a broader spectrum of de-
pression disorders (e.g., dysthymic disor-
der, or minor or subsyndromal depres-
sion) or symptoms that reﬂect comorbid
psychiatric illness (e.g., anxiety or sub-
stance-abuse disorders) or general dis-
tress.
The reason that depression was more
prevalent in the uncontrolled than in the
controlled studies is unclear. One possi-
bility is that the uncontrolled studies in-
cluded a higher proportion of individuals
recruited from settings with higher preva-
lences of depression (e.g., physician refer-
rals or university-based clinics). Although
similar ORs describing the likelihood of
depression were found between the clin-
ical and community studies, the uncon-
trolled studies were comprised almost
exclusively of clinic-based samples. Of
the 11 community studies in the con-
trolled subset, 8 restricted their samples
to older individuals; this further contrib-
utes to lower rates of depression in the
controlled studies, since depression is less
common in older than younger adults
(44). There may also be other unmea-
sured differences in clinical or functional
characteristics that might account for the
differences in the controlled and uncon-
trolled studies. For example, the associa-
tions of depression with hyperglycemia
and with increased risk of complications
described in recent meta-analytic reviews
(1,2) support the hypothesis that the se-
verity of diabetes and/or functional im-
pairment may increase the risk for
depression.
A difference in the prevalence of de-
pression in type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes
could not be established. The ORs from
the controlled studies were nearly identi-
cal between types, and aggregate esti-
mates of prevalence using controlled and
uncontrolled studies, segregated by de-
pression assessment method, also yielded
equivalent depression rates. Many of the
studies, including some with the largest
numbers of patients, did not report the
fraction of depressed individuals by type
of diabetes. This omission exempliﬁed a
more general failure of many studies to
fully characterize the depressed and non-
depressed samples. Such information is
needed to assess the effects of other fac-
tors (e.g., age, socioeconomic status, and
severity of diabetes) on the prevalence of
depression. In particular, failure to report
race or ethnicity is common in the psy-
chosocial literature on diabetes (45).
The ﬁndings of this review echo the
observation, ﬁrst made by Willis (46) in
1684, that depression is associated with
diabetes. The complex interactions of
physical, psychological, and genetic fac-
tors that contribute to this association re-
main uncertain. Depression may occur
secondary to the hardships of advancing
diabetes or to diabetes-related abnormal-
ities in neurohormonal or neurotransmit-
ter function (47–49). On the other hand,
evidence from prospective studies in the
U.S. and Japan indicates that depression
doubles the risk of incident type 2 diabe-
Figure 2—Aggregate prevalence of depression determined from self-report scales or diagnostic
interviews in controlled and uncontrolled studies, and in all studies combined. Estimates based on
self-report scales were signiﬁcantly higher than those based on diagnostic interviews in all three
comparisons. Depression was also higher in uncontrolled studies than in controlled studies that
used the same depression assessment method (diagnostic interviews: 14.2 vs. 9.0%; self-report

tes independent of its association with
other risk factors (50,51). In patients with
preexisting diabetes, depression is an in-
dependent risk factor for coronary heart
disease, and appears to accelerate the pre-
sentation of coronary heart disease (52–
54). Additional studies are needed to
identify the behavioral and physiological
mechanismsthataccountfortheseﬁndings.
This review has several limitations.
First, publication bias (i.e., nonpublica-
tion of studies that fail to ﬁnd the phe-
nomenon of interest) may limit the
generalizability of the ﬁndings. However,
this possibility is diminished by the fact
that depression was not the principal fo-
cus of many of the included studies and
was instead only one of a number of mea-
sured psychosocial variables. Second, the
depression prevalence estimates may be
unstable due to the small sample sizes of
some studies, the small number of stud-
ies, and the fact that many of the samples
were not population based. Third, the
methods used to calculate the overall
prevalence of depression in diabetic sub-
jects were certainly suboptimal in that we
were unable to perform a multivariate
analysis controlling for all potential mod-
erators. The fact that the ORs were uni-
formly similar in the bivariate tests was
encouraging, and suggests that the two-
fold increased likelihood of depression
associated with diabetes is the most ro-
bust and generalizable ﬁnding of this re-
view. Additional studies would be
required to determine more precisely the
prevalence of major depression and ele-
vated depression symptoms in the general
population of individuals with diabetes.
These studies should carefully measure
and report potential moderators so that
both adjusted and unadjusted depression
prevalence can be calculated and in-
cluded in the ﬁndings.
The third U.S. National Health and
Nutrition Education Examination Survey
found that 49% of insulin-treated diabe-
tic patients and 56% of those on oral hy-
poglycemic agents had HbA1c values
,8.0%, and very few patients sustained
HbA1c levels ,7.0%, the goal set by the
American Diabetes Association (55,56).
Depression may oppose efforts to achieve
normoglycemia via behavioral (41–43)
and physiological (57–60) pathways,
and, as shown in this review, is clinically
relevant in nearly one of every three pa-
tients with diabetes. Successful treatment
of depression is associated with improve-
ments in glycemic control (3–5). Never-
theless, two of every three cases of
depression are left untreated by primary
care physicians (61). Better recognition
and better treatment of depression are im-
portant in themselves, but they could also
improve medical outcome in a substantial
portion of patients with diabetes. This
meta-analysis helps to deﬁne the preva-
lence of depression in diabetes using data
from available studies and ﬁrmly estab-
lishes the increased risk of comorbidity.

11349477,True,True,"The advances made in the 1980s and 1990s have yielded many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of depression and dysthymia. Skill of the clinician is important in sorting out the diagnosis, taking care to consider the various medical conditions that can cause depression or disguise themselves as depression. Depressive disorders are highly treatable conditions. Clinicians must overcome the stigma associated with these disorders to alleviate the pain and suffering of those afflicted. The advances in treatment have been enormous and continue to grow. The keys to these treatments lie in continuing to acquire the knowledge to unlock all of the causes of depression. An appendix follows listing medications commonly used in the treatment of depression or for other conditions in patients under treatment for depression.","ADVANCES IN l

Of the leading causes of disability in the world, according to the 
World Health Organization, 5 of the top 10 disorders are psychiatric in 
origin.39 
The number one disorder with the highest disability-adjusted 
life-years (a measure of life lost, years lived with a disability, or prema- 
ture death) was unipolar 
Depression and its more chronic 
form of dysthymia received much attention during the 1990s. With the 
introduction of improved treatment alternatives, understanding depres- 
sion and dysthymia is essential. 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
fourth edition (DSM-IV), the lifetime prevalence for a major depressive 
disorder is 10% to 25% in women and 5% to 12% in men."" For dysthy- 
mia, the lifetime prevalence is 6%; 10% of individuals with dysthymic 
disorder develop a first major depressive episode each year."" A de- 
pressive disorder can occur at any age (although rates are highest in the 
25- to 44-year-old range),ll in either gender (although females have twice 
the risk), and in any socioeconomic class (individuals with a primary 
care physician and insurance are more likely to receive treatment).13 
There is a 1.5 to 3 times greater risk of developing a major depression if 
a person has a first-degree relative with a mood disorder.""

DIAGNOSTIC 
CRITERIA 
For a person to meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder, he 
or she must have five neurovegetative symptoms (one of which must be 
a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure) for the previous 
2-week time period with symptoms that cause impairment in social, 
occupational, or other important areas of functioning and are not due to 
a substance, general medical condition, or bereavement.l’ The neuroveg- 
etative symptoms can be remembered by the mnemonic SIGECAPS: 
changes in Sleep, Interest level, Guilt or worry, Energy, Concentration, 
Appetite, Psychomotor agitation or retardation, Suicide or thoughts of 
death. Other symptoms of depression include crying spells, feelings of 
hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, irritability, and decreased libido. 
Several valid screening tools are available to help in the diagnostic 
process, including the self-administered Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI)4 
and the clinician-administered Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM- 
D).22 
One study found, however, that the single question, “Are you 
depressed?’’ was more sensitive and more specific in detecting depres- 
sion in terminally ill cancer patients than a screening q~estionnaire.~ 
The criteria for dysthymic disorder are having a depressed mood 
for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years with the 
presence of at least two neurovegetative symptoms: appetite changes, 
insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy, low self-esteem, poor concentra- 
tion, and feelings of hopelessness.11 
The person with a dysthymic disor- 
der has not had a remittance of these symptoms for more than 2 months 
during that 2-year time period. Similar to a major depressive episode, 
the symptoms are not caused by a substance, general medical condition, 
or bereavement and do cause significant areas of impairment in function- 
There is fluidity between a major depressive disorder and dysthmia; 
studies have shown that most patients who are diagnosed with a dysthy- 
mic disorder go on to develop a major depression.28 
The term double 
depression is used to describe- 
the coexistence of both disorders. Asking 
the sensitive questions to obtain an accurate history is imperative for all 
medical conditions but is particularly important for psychiatric disorders 
because patients may be hesitant to discuss issues of mental health 
spontaneously. Going through the above-mentioned criteria is not time- 
consuming and can provide a wealth of information. The mortality of 
depression is high despite the advances in treatment modalities in the 
1990s. Of individuals with a major depressive disorder, 15% die by 
suicide.l* 
Simply asking, ”Have you had thoughts of hurting yourself?” 
may provide the information necessary to save a life. 
ing. 
NEUROBIOLOGY OF DEPRESSION 
For decades, the search for a cause and treatment for depression has 
centered on two primary neurochemicals: norepinephrine and serotonin. 
DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA 
633 
Their role in depression is complex in that the deficiency of one or the 
other is not enough to cause depression,1° suggesting a cascade of 
neurochemical events. The theory of depression with the most support 
surrounds the central fact that there is a deficiency of one or the other 
neurochemicals in the synapse between neurons. By increasing the con- 
centration in the synapse through inhibition of reuptake of the neuro- 
chemical, depression can be alleviated. In the 1960s and 1970s, the 
primary treatment consisted of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) 
and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The 1980s and 1990s focused on 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 
The premise behind all of 
these medications lies in the availability of norepinephrine or serotonin. 
Treatment with antidepressants usually takes 4 
to 6 weeks to show a 
response, yet the concentration in the synapse can be elevated within 
days of starting a medication. There are sure to be second messenger- 
type systems working in the overall spectrum of depression that also 
play a role. These downstream systems currently are under investigation 
and may hold further promise in the future for a more effective treat- 
ment for depression. 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES 
When considering a diagnosis on the depressive spectrum of illness, 
numerous other psychiatric and medical illnesses should be considered 
and investigated. One of the most prominent psychiatric disorders that 
often is comorbid with a depression is an anxiety disorder, with anxiety 
being present in 60% to 90% of patients with depre~sion.~~ 
Their integral 
tie to each other often can be confusing to the clinician when attempting 
to reach a diagnosis. A generalized anxiety disorder has extreme worry 
at its core as well as many neurovegetative symptoms, such as restless- 
ness, fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and a sleep distur- 
bance. A striking difference between anxiety and depression is that 
patients with anxiety generally lack anhedonia and thoughts of death. 
Because the neurobiology of anxiety disorders is thought to be modu- 
lated by the same neurotransmitters as the depressive disorders, often 
the same medications can alleviate symptoms of each disorder. 
Bereavement (or grief) can be mistaken for major depression. Grief 
is a normal human emotion occurring after a loss. Normal grief can 
evolve into a major depressive episode, however. If this evolution should 
occur, more pathologic symptoms can appear, including thoughts of 
death (other than a survivor feeling that he or she should have died 
with the deceased person), hallucinations (other than hearing the voice 
or seeing the image of the deceased), marked psychomotor retardation, 
morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, marked functional impair- 
ment, and marked guilt other than about actions taken or not taken at 
the time of the death.l' 
Adjustment disorders can cause marked distress and impairment in 
functioning, yet usually do not meet the neurovegetative criteria for a 
634 
MOORE & BONA 
major depression or dysthymic disorder. These types of disorders occur 
within 3 months of the onset of a specific stressor and resolve within 6 
months of the resolution of the stressor. Psychologic and social interven- 
tions are the primary treatment for an adjustment disorder."" If indicated, 
there may be a need for short-term augmentation of pharmacologic 
interventions, usually benzodiazepines.u Long-term psychopharmaco- 
therapy usually is not indicated for an uncomplicated adjustment disor- 
der. 
Abuse and dependence on substances can lead to a picture similar 
to depression. 
Treatment must consist of a detoxification from the abused 
substance, then a re-evaluation of the depressive symptoms. Alcohol, 
benzodiazepines, barbituates, cocaine, and opiates are notorious causes 
o
f
 neurovegetative-like symptoms with a depressed affect or suicidal 
ideation. Lydiard et a P  
showed that depressive symptoms emerged in 
one third o
f
 patients with panic disorder treated with alprazolam. The 
clinician must be mindful that many people self-medicate a depression 
with substances of abuse, reinforcing the need for a thorough history. 
Many medical illnesses cause signs of depression. Thyroid disorders 
(hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), strokes (especially left-sided 
frontal cerebrovascular accidents), other neurologic disorders such as 
Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, vitamin deficiencies, human 
immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(HIV/AIDS), autoimmune disorders, cancer (especially of the pancreas), 
pregnancy (especially postpartum), and anemias all need to be consid- 
ered when a person presents for a first evaluation for depression. Al- 
though a full battery of laboratory and radiologic tests generally is not 
indicated in all individuals, the clinician must be mindful of medical 
disorders when doing a thoughtful assessment. 
COMORBIDITY WITH MEDICAL ILLNESSES 
Depression is being linked with many medical disorders. These 
links have long been suspected, but direct evidence has been lacking in 
the past. Musselman et a14"" 
found a strong association between cardiac 
disease and depression, whereby depression is a predisposing factor to 
a cascade of events that may lead to a myocardial infarction. Although 
the high rate of smoking among depressed patients may explain part of 
this association, a large prospective study showed increased rates of 
fatality among depressed smokers and depressed nonsmokers.2 
Studies 
suggest that depression impairs parasympathetic modulation of heart 
rate and contractility30 
and increases the likelihood of thrombus forma- 
t i ~ n . ~ ~  
Studies have shown an increased morbidity and mortality in 
patients with depressive symptoms, implicating depression as an inde-

strong association with premature ventricular  contraction^.'^ With de-

formation,42 
mortality and morbidity also are influenced in central ner- 
vous system pathology. In a study involving poststroke patients, those 
with depression or dysthymia were 3.4 times more likely to have died 
during the 10-year follow-up period than were nondepressed patients.38 
Direct links with other illnesses are not as well documented. When 
individuals are depressed, many tend to self-medicate with alcohol and 
drugs of abuse to numb their emotional pain. Studies have shown a link 
between depression and migraines: 
35 which is important because of the 
relatively high rate of suicide attempts in patients with the comorbid 
illnesses.6 
SUICIDE 
As stated previously, the mortality of depressive disorders cannot 
be overstated. Major depression carries a 15% lifetime risk for completed 
suicide.ll Of severely depressed patients, 80% have suicidal ideations.24 
Depressions associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia carry a 
significant 10% to 15% 
risk of suicide. All physicians are taught to ask 
about suicide in a mental status examination, but studies indicate that 
many physicians49 
often do not ask about suicidal thoughts, even in 
patients they have identified correctly as depressed. A common excuse 
physicians give for not asking is that they do not want to give the 
patient any ideas. This is a myth with no basis in reality and research. 
There are demographics that may help a clinician identify patients 
at risk for suicide. Men are more likely to complete suicide, usually with 
a violent method. Women are more likely to attempt suicide. The risk 
factors for suicide are being male; being elderly or adolescent; having 
substance abuse, especially alcohol; having a chronic medical condition; 
having financial problems; previous attempts; family history of suicide; 
and having a well-developed plan.51 
Severe anxiety, agitation, and panic 
attacks have a strong correlation of suicide risk.*l, 
52 It is important to 
involve family members in the assessment of suicide risk because 60% of 
patients who ultimately committed suicide communicated their suicidal 
ideation to their spouse, compared with only 18% who communicated 
suicidal ideation to a trained professional within 1 
year of the suicide.48 
TREATMENT OPTIONS 
Although much national discussion occurred on the use of psychiat- 
ric medications in the 1990s, more recent studies have indicated that 
most individuals affected with a depressive illness do not receive treat- 
ment. A study involving 312 patients with a major depression showed 
that only 7.4% of them were taking an antidepre~sant.'~ 
Race, gender, 
and income did not affect significantly the use (or lack of use) of an 
antidepressant, but there was a 4-fold increase in the use of antidepres- 
sants in individuals with health insurance or a primary care pr0~ider.l~ 
636 
MOORE & BONA 
The first-line treatment for depressive disorders has focused primar- 
ily on the newer agents for depression. As of this time, with more than 
a decade o
f
 research and comparisons, no antidepressant has shown 
superior efficacy over another antidepressant for a major depressive 
disorder. Although there have been reports indicating one medicine over 
another for a particular subset of patients, none have shown a general 
superiority. The TCAs, MAOIs, SSRIs, and all other newer agents have 
shown an approximate efficacy of 60% to 70% in most patients. The 
side-effect 
burden and lethality of older agents such as TCAs and MAOIs 
have resulted in them usually being reserved for resistant or specialty 
patients. 
Most clinicians choose an SSRI for the first-line treatment of de- 
pressive disorders. The SSRIs currently available are fluoxetine, sertra- 
line, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and citalopram. These agents work on 
serotonin reuptake exclusively. 
All are generally well tolerated, although 
all the agents share side effects to varying degrees. Nausea and head- 
aches are the most common side effects, but patients need to be educated 
that these side effects generally dissipate within the first month of use. 
Sexual side effects, either decreased libido or delayed ability (or com- 
plete inability) to have an orgasm, can be a more long-standing side 
effect. Per package inserts, sexual dysfunction occurs in approximately 
4
%
 to 8% of patients, but clinicians agree that the incidence is much 
higher in actual clinical practice,2O perhaps 30% to 40% of individuals on 
 antidepressant^.^^ About 50% of patients do not experience adverse 
effects with SSRIs, and in patients who do, the side effects usually are 
mild.36 
All SSlUs except fluvoxamine are indicated for a once-per-day 
dosing regimen. All have active metabolites except for paroxetine and 
fluvoxamine. 
The other newer agents sometimes are referred to as atypical antide- 
pressants because there is a lack of a common theme among them. 
Buproprion is a weak serotonin reuptake agent but has its main effects 
on norepinephrine reuptake and dopamine reuptake to a smaller de- 
gree.'* This unique action has enabled buproprion to be used as an 
antidepressant that also has been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use in smoking cessation. Studies are investi- 
gating its potential for use in attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder. It 
has similar side effects to the SSRIs, but little sexual dysfunction effects. 
The slowrrelease form usually is recommended for a twice-per-day dos- 
ing schedule. 
Nefazodone works primarily by blocking 5-hydroxytryptamine 
(HT,) receptors postsynaptically 
but also has effects as a serptonin reup- 
take inhibit~r.'~ 
The serotonin in the synapse can be more concentrated 
on the 5-HT, receptors, which theoretically are implicated in depressive 
and anxiety disorders. Nefazodone shares its side-effect profile with 
the SSRIs but with increased sedation properties. There is little sexual 
dysfunction associated with nefazodone. It has a twice-per-day dosing 
regimen. 
Venlafaxine acts primarily as an SSRI in doses of 150 mg or less. In 
DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA 
637 
higher dosages, this medicine takes on significant noradrenergic proper- 
ties.19 This medication may be the most similar to the TCAs, although 
without the full TCA side-effect profile. Venlafaxine has the same side 
effects as the SSRIs including sexual dysfunction. In doses greater than 
225 mg, there has been an increase in blood pressure so that careful 
monitoring should ensue when higher doses are indicated. There is a 
9% risk of blood pressure elevation at doses of 300 mg/d or 
The extended-release 
form is indicated for once-per-day dosing. 
Mirtazapine is one of the more recent agents introduced for depres- 
sion. It has a unique mode of action, involving postsynaptic 5-HT2 
and 
5-HT3 
blockade. Its main action is in blocking a,-noradrenergic receptors, 
resulting in a release of inhibition of the 5-HT neuron and release from 
negative feedback of the noradrenergic neuron.19 
It has fewer reported 
sexual side effects but has significant weight gain and sedation proper- 
ties. For this reason, this medication may be used best in cachetic, 
anxious, medically ill patients, particularly geriatric, cancer, or HIV- 
infected patients. 
Reboxetine is the most recent antidepressant agent that is expected 
to gain FDA approval within the next year. Available in Europe, it is a 
sole norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with little to no serotoninergic 
action. Reboxetine appears to be at least as efficacious as the TCAs and 
SSRIs.5, 37 The most common side effects are dry mouth, headache, 
nausea, sweating, constipation, and hypotension5; there is no known 
inhibition of any cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme.12 
Older antidepressants still are used for the treatment of depression, 
although with generally lower frequency. The TCAs and MAOIs are 
equally effective treatments for depression. The TCAs work primarily 
with norepinephrine reuptake mechanisms, although some, especially 
clomipramine, have serotoninergic properties as well. Cardiac conduc- 
tion effects and lethality in overdose limit the continued widespread use 
of TCAs. The TCAs should be avoided in patients with a history of 
seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, narrow-angle glaucoma, and benign 
prostatic hypertrophy. These latter two reasons are secondary to the 
anticholinergic properties of these medicines, which also may cause a 
risk of delirium, especially in the geriatric population. MAOIs work by 
inhibiting monoamine oxidase, the main enzyme in the breakdown of 
norepinephrine and serotonin, elevating the levels of those neurochemi- 
cals. A strict tyramine-free diet (i.e. aged cheese, wine, alcohol) must be 
followed if one is taking MAOIs. It is important to limit use of other 
medications, mainly cough and cold-type medications, other antidepres- 
sants, and meperidine, which has documented lethality with an MAOI.29 
Overall, with appropriate dosages and length of treatment, a com- 
plete remission is shown in 30% of patients; a partial response, in 40% 
of patients; and no improvement, in 30% of patients.20 
The length of 
treatment with medication for major depression varies from 6 months 
to 3 years, but Frank et all6 
recommend a trial of antidepressants for 3 
years secondary to the chronicity and recurrence of this illness. Patients 
with recurrent depressive episodes less than 2.5 years apart merit contin- 
638 
MOORF.&BONA 
ued full-dose treatment for at least 5 years.31 
Keller et alZ6 
found that a 
high proportion of patients stop treatment after only a slight improve- 
ment, then remain in moderate to low levels of depression. Recurrence 
of episodes of depression is common; the risk of recurrence increases by 
16% 
with each successive epis0de.5~ 
Solomon et a153 
showed that there is 
an average of two recurrences in the 10 years after an index episode of 
depression in 318 subjects that were studied, with each episode lasting 
an average of 20 weeks? Hirschfeld and SchatzbergZ recommend life- 
long maintenance treatment after a third lifetime episode of major de- 
pression. 
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated for the treatment of 
depression. Its efficacy is reported at 80% to 90?'0.~~ 
If unilateral treat- 
ments are done, main side effects are short-term memory loss (usually 
o
f
 the day of ECT), which resolve within 2 weeks of discontinuation of 
ECT. Theoretically, ECT works by causing a massive neurochemical 
release from the induced seizure. Its effects are quick and immediate, 
usually working within 2 weeks of beginning treatments. The acute 
effects of ECT are usually temporary, however, lasting only 1 to 2 
months. After ECT has lifted the patient out of the depths of the 
depression, the patient needs to resume pharmacotherapy or continue 
in maintenance ECT to prevent a relapse or recurrence of depressive 
symptoms. ECT is indicated for depression that has proved resistant 
to medications, catatonic states, mania, or psychosis unresponsive to 
medications as well as life-threatening depressive states that cannot wait 
the 4 
to 6 weeks for the traditional antidepressant effect.41 
These life- 
threatening states primarily involve an acutely suicidal patient or a 
medically compromised patient whose physical condition is deteriorat- 
ing markedly because of the depression. 
Psychotherapy has long been one of the prominent treatments for 
depression. Historically the scientific research on these modalities of 
treatment has been lacking secondary to a number of reasons, such as 
ethical concerns and difficulty regarding placebo issues. Keller et alZ7 
showed equal efficacy between pharmacotherapy (with nefazodone) and 
psychotherapy (with cognitive-behavioral analysis). Monotherapy pro- 
duced a positive response rate in 52% to 55% of the patients. Although 
pharmacotherapy produced results more rapidly than psychotherapy, 
both treatments approached similar efficacy by week 12 of the study. 
When these two modalities are combined, the rate of response increases 
to 85%, showing the superior efficacy of the combination approach to 
the treatment of depression. There are many forms of psychotherapy, 
ranging from psychoanalysis to cognitive-behavioral 
to family therapy; 
a full evaluation by a mental health professional can assist in making 
the referral for the most appropriate form of therapy and professional. 
CYTOCHROME P-450 SYSTEM 
Much has been theorized, publicized, and debated regarding the 
cytochrome P-450 system. All of the newer antidepressants are cleared 
DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA 
639 
through the P-450 system. There are strong interactions to be aware of, 
especially when administering warfarin with any of the antidepressants. 
Theophylline, clozapine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, antiarrhythmics, 
terfenadine, astemizole, and antipsychotics all can be influenced by the 
actions of antidepressants on the P-450 system. Sertraline and venlafax- 
ine have been regarded as the medicines with the least interactions with 
other medications. Sertraline has minimal significant effects on the 2D6, 
3A4, and 2C6 pathways, whereas venlafaxine is the least protein bound 
(17% 
versus >80% for others) of the antidepressants and has only weak 
effects on 2D6 i~oenzymes.~~ 
The clinician must remain cognizant of all 
the medications a patient receives because all types of medicines, not 
just psychiatric in origin, can have drug-drug interactions. 
SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS 
Pregnant Patients 
Of pregnant women, 70% report depressive sympt0ms,3~ 
and 10% 
of pregnant women meet criteria for a mood disorder.55 
Maternity blues, 
a mild depression that affects 50% to 85% of postpartum women, usually 
is transient and requires little inte~ention.~~ 
Approximately 20% of 
women with maternity blues go on to develop a major depression,% 
affecting 10% to 22% of all postpartum women. All antidepressants are 
rated as category C, meaning there is no human clinical evidence to link 
teratogenesis 
with the medicine, but animal models are either lacking or 
have raised concerns. All of the antidepressants are secreted in breast 
milk, although there is debate regarding paroxetine. Before medications 
are started in a pregnant patient, Stowe et a155 
recommend guidelines to 
follow, with the strongest recommendation being patient education and 
documentation supporting the decision. There are no known fetal abnor- 
malities or future learning disabilities associated with antidepres- 
~ a n t s , 4 ~ , ~ ~  
but there are significant risks to the fetus of an untreated 
mother with a major depression, given the 15% risk of completed sui- 
cide. Also, in considering treatment for the postpartum depressed 
mother, one must weigh in factors such as the mother’s ability to bond 
with a new infant and the unknown implications if this bond is harmed 
by a depressive disorder. 
Children and Adolescents 
A discussion of the treatment of depression in children and adoles- 
cents is beyond the scope of this article, but several principles are 
worthy of review. There are no FDA-approved treatment modalities for 
depression in children and adolescents. None of the medications dis- 
cussed in this article are approved for use in patients younger than 18 
years old except for TCAs in the treatment of enuresis. Clinically, 
pediat-

ric psychopharmacology follows most adult models, however. Dosages 
are usually lower as is typical in general pediatric pharmacology, al- 
though studies with fluoxetine and sertraline have suggested dosages 
equivalent to adult m0de1s.l~ 
Existing pediatric studies are confounded 
by small sample sizes and lack of double-blind controls. In evaluating 
the pediatric patient, most children with mood disorders have a family 
history of such di~0rders.l~ 
Parental reports as well as teacher evalua- 
tions are crucial in making a thorough assessment. 
Geriatric Patients 
Depression is the most frequent mood disorder among elderly per- 
sons.’ As pointed out in the previous discussion of suicide, elderly men 
have some of the highest risk factors for suicide and account for the 
bimodal peak in numbers of suicides seen in later life. This group of 
patients often is the least likely to discuss mental health issues openly. 
Clinicians must pursue actively the history necessary to make a diagno- 
sis reliably, often needing to gather more collateral history from patients’ 
families.32 
Clinicians must keep in mind the many comorbid medical 
issues of this population. Cancers, HIV, dementias, and other chronic 
illnesses can be reasons for depression. They are not excuses for depres- 
sion, however. The depression should be treated as aggressively as 
any medical illness. Treating the depression may improve the patient’s 
motivation, improving compliance with the psychiatric and medical 
treatment plan. 
REFERRALS 
Primary care clinicians currently are the sources of frontline treat- 
ment for most depressive illnesses, given their vast number of daily 
patient encounters. First episodes of depression and uncomplicated ma- 
jor depression often can be treated within the confines of the primary 
care clinic. Referrals to psychiatrists should be considered when the 
depression is resistant to standard medications, when psychosis is pres- 
ent in the depression, when there is suspicion or evidence of a manic or 
hypomanic period, when suicide attempts are part of the patient’s his- 
tory or current episode, and when the patient’s physical. state would 
become compromised if one waits for an antidepressant medication to 
reach efficacy. If psychotherapy is requested by the patient or if the 
clinician believes there are numerous psychosocial stressors on the pa- 
tient, a referral to a mental health professional for psychotherapy is 
warranted. 
DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA 
641 
SUMMARY 
The advances made in the 1980s and 1990s have yielded many 
advances in the diagnosis and treatment of depression and dysthymia. 
Skill of the clinician is important in sorting out the diagnosis, taking 
care to consider the various medical conditions that can cause depression 
or disguise themselves as depression. Depressive disorders are highly 
treatable conditions. Clinicians must overcome the stigma associated 
with these disorders to alleviate the pain and suffering of those afflicted. 
The advances in treatment have been enormous and continue to grow. 
The keys to these treatments lie in continuing to acquire the knowledge 
to unlock all of the causes of depression. 
An appendix follows listing medications commonly used in the 
treatment of depression or for other conditions in patients under treat- 
ment for depression.

Major depression is a common mental health disorder in
adolescents that predicts a significant risk for recurrence in
adulthood. Suicide is the third most frequent cause of deaths
in this age group, and depression is a significant risk factor for
suicidal ideation and attempts. Risks for depression and
suicidal ideation are reviewed, and subtypes of depression are
discussed. Difficulties associated with identification of
depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents and biologic
therapies for adolescent depression are reviewed. Curr Opin
Pediatr 2001, 13:586–590 © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.
Major depression is one of the most common mental
health disorders in adolescence, with an estimated preva-
lence of 4 to 8% [1•,2]. Individuals who experience ma-
jor depression by age 19 are at significant risk for recur-
rence in adulthood [3]. Major depression is costly and is
projected to become the second leading cause of disabil-
ity worldwide by 2020 [4]. In addition to economic costs,
major depression is associated with increased risk for
other mental health disorders including substance abuse,
attempted and completed suicide, and academic and so-
cial derailment [5]. Concern regarding the social and eco-
nomic burden of depression and other mental health is-
sues has lead to a 25-nation study of mental health issues
by the World Health Organization as well as an evalua-
tion by the Institute of Medicine on chronic neuropsy-
chiatric problems [6]. An excellent review of epidemiol-
ogy, clinical presentation and course, comorbid disorders,
and treatment is presented in the American Academy
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry practice parameters
for depressive disorders [7]. Birmaher [2] also has re-
viewed psychopharmacologic treatment in adolescent
depression.
Risks for depression
A meta-analysis of genetic epidemiologic data showed
that major depression is a complex disorder that does not
result from either genetic or environmental factors alone,
but rather from an interaction of risk factors [8]. Major
depression is described as a familial disorder that is me-
diated through genetic mechanisms. Environmental in-
fluences specific to an individual also are significant. A
recent prospective study evaluated the familial risk for
major depression in individuals with prepubertal onset
versus adolescent onset depression [9]. Probands in this
study included youth with prepubertal onset depression,
adolescent onset depression, and controls. Longitudinal
data were obtained at follow up 10 to 15 years later. Both
prepubertal onset and adolescent onset depression were
associated significantly with a family history of major
depression. For prepubertal onset, family history of de-
pression was significantly associated with recurrence of
depression. In contrast, family history was not associated
with recurrence for the adolescent onset group. How-
ever, the adolescent onset group did have significantly
higher lifetime rates of comorbid anxiety disorders and
conduct disorders.
In attempting to identify predictors of recurrence,
Lewinsohn et al. [1•] evaluated 274 individuals with ado-
lescent onset depression on two occasions. The first as-

sessment was during adolescence and the second after
they were 24 years of age. Female gender, multiple ma-
jor depressive episodes in adolescence, higher proportion
of family members with recurrent major depression, and
elevated symptoms of borderline personality disorder in-
dependently predicted recurrence of depression. Con-
flict with parents predicted recurrence for females only.
Comorbid anxiety, substance abuse disorders, and el-
evated antisocial personality disorder symptoms distin-
guished adolescents who developed recurrent depression
with comorbid psychiatric disorders versus those with
pure major depression. By age 24, one-third remained
free of illness and two-thirds developed depression or
another psychiatric disorder. For those who developed a
psychiatric disorder other than depression between the
ages19 to 23 years, 77% had a diagnosis of substance use
disorder. As noted by Martin and Cohen [5], identifica-
tion of the potential for significant progression from de-
pression to substance abuse provides a window of oppor-
tunity for early intervention and treatment to reduce the
future burden of substance abuse in this population.
Likewise, given that 46% had a recurrence of depression,
targeted psychoeducation and ongoing intermittent
monitoring for depression also may facilitate early inter-
vention and treatment.
Clinical presentation
In attempting to characterize depressive disorders it re-
mains unclear if major depression is meaningfully differ-
ent from dysthymia. Both disorders share many of the
same symptoms but differ in acuity and severity. Good-
man et al. [10] report data from youths with major de-
pression alone, dysthymia alone, and major depression
with dysthymia. The three groups did not differ in terms
of sociodemographic, clinical, or life-event variables.
Youths with major depression and dysthymia showed sig-
nificantly less competence and more impairment than for
either disorder alone. The combination of these disor-
ders probably represents a more serious form of depres-
sive pathology, which is more likely to cause serious dis-
ruptions in normal developmental processes.
A number of clinical presentations have been character-
ized as subtypes of depression. Similar to depressed
adults, depressed youths have been shown to have psy-
chotic, melancholic, bipolar, subsyndromal, and seasonal
subtypes [7,11]. The incidence of psychotic symptoms in
a pediatric mood and anxiety disorders clinic was exam-
ined recently by Ulloa et al. [12]. Of the 2031 patients
screened, definite psychosis was found in 4.5% of this
population, and 62% of those with psychosis were diag-
nosed as having a major depression or subsyndromal
depression.
Williamson et al. [13] evaluated 1046 youths with major
depression for features of atypical depression. Atypical
depression was defined as having mood reactivity and at
least one of the following: hypersomnia, increased appe-
tite, weight gain, or psychomotor retardation. Using this
definition, 15.5% of the depressed youths met criteria for
atypical depression. This frequency is similar to the es-
timate of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study for
atypical depression in depressed adults (15.7%). These
atypically depressed adolescents were more likely to at-
tribute their depressive episode to a specific event than
others in the cohort.
Suicide
Depression is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation
and attempts. The American Academy of Pediatrics re-
cently has reviewed risk factors and recommended man-
agement approaches for suicidal adolescents [14]. Sui-
cide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents
aged 15 to 19 years [15]. Risk factors include a history of
depression, previous suicide attempt, a family history of
psychiatric disorders, family disruption, chronic or debili-
tating physical illnesses, and other psychiatric disorders.
Additional risks include living out of the home or a his-
tory of physical or sexual abuse. Psychosocial difficulties
commonly noted in young people who attempt suicide
include conflicts with parents, relationship break-ups,
school and legal difficulties, and social isolation.
Although psychosocial factors have been associated with
suicidal ideation, causality is difficult to determine.
Many psychosocial difficulties may be secondary to hav-
ing a depressive disorder that interferes with maintaining
relationships and capacity to function. DiFilippo and
Overholser [16] examined 59 adolescent psychiatric in-
patients for suicidal ideation, depression, and attachment
problems. Although attachment initially related to sui-
cidal ideation, most of the association could be explained
by the association with depressive symptoms. Overall,
self-reported depressive symptoms remained the strong-
est predictor of suicidal ideation.
Prinstein et al. [17] evaluated 96 psychiatric inpatients
hospitalized for concerns of suicidality and reported that
perceived peer rejection and lower levels of close friend-
ship support were associated with more severe suicidal
ideation. While generalized anxiety, conduct problems
and substance use symptoms were associated with sui-
cidal ideation, these symptoms were no longer signifi-
cantly associated with suicidal ideation when depression
symptoms were controlled. Deviant peer affiliation and
global family dysfunction was associated indirectly with
suicidal ideation via substance use and depression.
These findings lend further support for the strong me-
diating role that depression plays in the onset of suicidal
ideation.
A longitudinal follow-up study of eight-year-old children
revealed that these early emotional and behavioral prob-
lems were correlated with suicidal thoughts and attempts
Depression in adolescence Sampson and Mrazek 587
eight years later [18]. Early antisocial symptoms noted by
parents and teachers, as well as early depressive symp-
toms reported by the child, were associated with suicidal
ideation and attempts eight years later.
In a community sample of adolescents screened and re-
evaluated two years later, a total of 8.2% had attempted
suicide at some time in their lives, and 2.7% reported an
attempt during the two-year study period [19•]. Future
attempts were predicted by previous attempt, female
gender, young age, alcohol intoxication, poor self-worth,
and not residing with both parents. Perceived early pu-
bertal development was an additional predictive variable
for girls.
Peers of suicide attempters have been noted to carry a
higher risk for suicidal ideation than peers of suicide
completers [20]. Close friends of suicide completers
were noted to be at risk for internalizing problems,
whereas peers of suicide attempters were at risk for ex-
ternalizing problems. These findings suggest that the
peers of both attempters and completers may be at in-
crease risk for psychiatric illness. Gay and bisexual ado-
lescents have been reported to have high rates of depres-
sion. In particular, gay youths are at least three times
more likely to attempt suicide than other adolescents
[14,21].
In an attempt to characterize suicidal crises, Joiner et al.
[22] analyzed suicidal crises of youths admitted to an
inpatient psychiatric unit. They showed that youths with
multiple suicide attempts experienced episodes of in-
creased severity but not duration of symptoms when
compared with adolescents with only suicidal ideation or
who had made a single suicide attempt.
Identification and service care
Given the high proportion of adolescent deaths from sui-
cide and the increased risk associated with depression,
optimizing identification and treatment of both suicidal
ideation and depression in teenagers is a significant pub-
lic health issue. Briggs-Gowen et al. [23] screened chil-
dren in a pediatric setting for psychiatric disorders and
found the prevalence for any psychiatric disorder to be
16.8%. In a Finnish study of the general population, 94%
of the respondents in late adolescence who reported a
mental disorder had used primary care services in the
previous year, while only 14% reported using mental
health services. All suicidal adolescents had visited pri-
mary care services, while only 8% had been in contact
with mental health services. In the Sourander et al [18]
longitudinal study of suicidal thoughts and attempts,
only 20% of the adolescents with suicidal ideation had
been referred to mental health services. These findings
provide further support for the importance of primary
care physicians in identifying depression and suicidal
ideation in youths.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated the
need for screening for depression, suicidal thoughts and
other risk factors for suicide (eg, firearms in the home)
[14]. Unfortunately a recent evaluation of primary care
providers for adolescents revealed that most pediatri-
cians and family physicians do not routinely screen for
suicidality or associated risk factors [24]. This study re-
ported that 47% of the providers had one or more ado-
lescent patients attempt suicide in the previous year.
Five percent of the providers reported that they had at
least one adolescent patient successfully complete sui-
cide. Only 23% of physicians reported frequently or al-
ways screening for suicide. In contrast, 54% reported fre-
quently or always screening for depression. The most
frequently monitored risks for adolescent suicide were
alcohol use (75%) and other substance use (71%). Prior
suicide attempts were frequently or always screened by
only 22% of the responders. Only one-third of the re-
sponders thought they had enough time during a well
visit to screen for mental health issues. A similar number
felt insufficiently trained to screen for adolescent sui-
cide. Seventy-two percent reported an interest in more
training on preventing adolescent suicide.

hood depression has shown that most physicians report
inadequate training and lack of comfort in the manage-
ment of childhood depression [25]. Family physicians
used medications to manage depression, prescribed
medications before referral to a specialist, and prescribed
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) more fre-
quently than pediatricians. Pediatricians were more
likely to refer depressed patients for counseling. Very
few primary care physicians conducted counseling ses-
sions in their offices.
As noted by Wolraich [26], one barrier to primary care
physicians providing services has been inadequate com-
pensation for mental health activities. This inadequate
reimbursement for providing care for children with men-
tal illness has likely decreased the opportunity for earlier
intervention, and the subsequent potential to reduce the
severity and course of a depressive disorder.
Once a mental health issue has been identified, access to
mental health services can be an issue [27]. Attempts to
restrain health costs have resulted in decreased availabil-
ity of mental health and substance abuse services for
children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has de-
veloped a consensus statement aimed at addressing some
of the difficulties with primary screening and in obtain-
ing adequate referral resources.
Other issues that will need to be addressed to optimize
care are the need for reliable and efficient screening
measures [24] and comprehensive treatment plans. The
latter is particularly important, as compliance with out-
588 Psychiatry
patient therapy is often poor [14]. Pelkonen et al. [28]
found that adolescents with mood disorders, especially
major depression, were less likely to dropout of outpa-
tient psychiatric care than those with substance abuse.
Adolescents attending two or fewer outpatient appoint-
ments (early dropouts) comprised 11% of the psychiatric
outpatients in the study. These teenagers were charac-
terized by low parental socioeconomic status, involve-
ment in foster care, problems with the law, and less sui-
cidal behavior. The fact that adolescents with mood
disorders were more likely to remain in treatment lends
hope that, once a referral to psychiatric care has been
made, there is good potential for recovery.
Reliable and valid self-report measures for safety risk
would be helpful for initial screening. The Reasons for
Living Inventory for Adolescents (RFL-A) is a 32-item
self-report measure designed to assess adolescents’ ratio-
nal for not committing suicide. Gutierrez et al. [29] ad-
ministered the RFL-A to a group of 206 adolescent psy-
chiatric inpatients and report that it is a valid and reliable
measure of adolescent suicide potential. The RFL-A was
found to have a better predicitive power than the Beck
Hopelessness Scale. A simple mnemonic (“FACED
WITH GUILT”), which can be used by clinicians to cue
screening for suicide risk, has also been described [30].
This mnemonic also includes questions to cue screening
for depression.
Biological therapies
A number of authors have argued that tricyclic antide-
pressants are no more effective than placebo in treating
depression in children and adolescents [2,31, 32•,33]. In
attempting to understand the difference in response
rates between youths and adults, Birmaher [2] suggests
that this could be a result of faster metabolism in chil-
dren. Alternatively it may be that the central noradren-
ergic system may develop later than the serotonergic sys-
tem in children. A hypothesis of faster metabolism in
children is supported by data showing the half-life of
nefazodone to be shorter in both children and adoles-
cents. The nefazodone half-life was shown to be 3.5
hours, 3.9 hours, and 7 hours for children, adolescents,
and adults, respectively.
In the past 11 years there have been three randomized,
double-blind control trials using SSRIs to treat depres-
sion in youths. The first was a study by Simeon et al. [34]
with 40 adolescents given fluoxetine or placebo. This
study showed no superiority of fluoxetine versus pla-
cebo. The second study had 96 child and adolescent
patients and fluoxetine was shown to be superior to pla-
cebo with response rates of 58% and 32%, respectively
[35]. As discussed by Emslie [36], these conflicting find-
ings could be explained by the small sample size of the
Simeon et al. study, which resulted in the study being
under-powered.
The largest study published to date included 275 ado-
lescents randomized to paroxetine, imipramine, or pla-
cebo [37•]. Paroxetine was superior to placebo. No sig-
nificance was found between imipramine and placebo in
treating adolescent depression.
TCAs are no longer considered first-line medications for
treating child and adolescent depression [7]. The afore-
mentioned double-blind, randomized control trials show-
ing the efficacy of SSRI in depression have clearly
changed prescribing practices for the treatment of de-
pression in adolescence. In addition to the documented
efficacy of SSRIs, the increased tolerability of side ef-
fects, once daily dosing, and low lethality in overdose
also support this shift in practice.
Similar to adults, adolescents can have treatment-
resistant depression that does not respond to medications
and psychotherapy [7]. Although used infrequently, elec-
troconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used for treat-
ment-resistant depression in adolescents. Scott et al. [38]
reported a higher rate of ECT use in adolescents than
has been previously noted (5 vs 1/million total popula-
tion). The authors note that this rate remains well below
that for ECT use in the general adult population
(26.3/million total population). Taieb et al. [39] retro-
spectively evaluated adolescent patients who had re-
ceived ECT and their parents. Despite more fear ex-
pressed by adolescent patients and their parents, than
adults who received ECT, adolescents and their parents
expressed an overall positive attitude toward the use of
ECT. Although explanations regarding ECT were given
before treatment, many adolescent patients and their
parents had notable misunderstandings regarding ECT
treatment. Many parents expressed the sentiment that it
had been difficult to give consent to administering ECT
to their own child.
Although there has been some concern that ECT use in
adolescents may result in long-term cognitive deficits,
Cohen et al. [40] reported no significant cognitive deficits
in adolescent patients who had ECT when compared
with controls. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimula-
tion (rTMS) is a novel treatment using brief magnetic
pulses to stimulate the brain. It has been shown to have
potential benefit in treatment resistant depression in
adults [41]. A recent review of rTMS use in seven ado-
lescents with mood disorders and schizophrenia reported
a clinical response in five subjects [42]. Given that rTMS
does not require anesthesia, and has not been associated
with significant cognitive side effects, this may become
an option for treatment resistant depression in adoles-
cents in future.
Conclusion
Identification and treatment of depression and suicidal
ideation in adolescents is a significant public health is-
sue. There is a need to optimize screening, prevention,

and treatment for depression in adolescence. Increased
education and awareness among primary care physicians
regarding risk factors and symptoms of depression and
suicidal ideation is needed. More randomized control
studies also are needed to study the biologic therapies
available for treating depression in adolescence.
