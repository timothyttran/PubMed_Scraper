Children and adolescents were also greatly impacted by the abrupt withdrawal from school, social life and outdoor activities. Some of them also experienced domestic violence growing. The stress they are subjected to directly impacts their mental health on account of increased anxiety, changes in their diets and in school dynamics, fear or even failing to scale the problem. Our aim is to bring up a discussion under different aspects and to alert public health and government agents about the need for surveillance and care of these individuals. We hope that the damage to their mental health as a result of the side effect of this pandemic can be mitigated by adequate and timely intervention.",03/02/2021,"{'de Figueiredo, Camila Saggioro': ['Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil.']}",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,eng,"['Adolescents', 'COVID-19', 'Children', 'Mental health', 'Social isolation', 'Stress']",['mental health']
1,34668012,10.1093/jmp/jhab032,Mental Health Without Well-being.,"What is it to be mentally healthy? In the ongoing movement to promote mental health, to reduce stigma, and to establish parity between mental and physical health, there is a clear enthusiasm about this concept and a recognition of its value in human life. However, it is often unclear what mental health means in all these efforts and whether there is a single concept underlying them. Sometimes, the initiatives for the sake of mental health are aimed just at reducing mental illness, thus implicitly identifying mental health with the absence of diagnosable psychiatric disease. More ambitiously, there are high-profile proposals to adopt a positive definition, identifying mental health with psychic or even overall well-being. We argue against both: a definition of mental health as mere absence of mental illness is too thin, too undemanding, and too closely linked to psychiatric value judgments, while the definition in terms of well-being is too demanding and potentially oppressive. As a compromise, we sketch out a middle position. On this view, mental health is a primary good, that is, the psychological preconditions of pursuing any conception of the good life, including well-being, without being identical to well-being.",12/02/2021,"{'Sandre, Poliana Capucho': ['NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Thymus Research Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.']}",The Journal of medicine and philosophy,eng,"['definition of health', 'happiness', 'medicalization', 'mental health', 'psychological flexibility', 'well-being']",['mental health']
2,35026808,No DOI,Mental Health and Spirituality.,"The paper deals with relation of spirituality and religion as well as its influence on mental and spiritual health. It analyzes how people use their beliefs and religion as help in restoring balance necessary for attaining mental health. The paper also points out the significance of spirituality and spiritual peace as the component of mental health and its preservation. The purpose of this paper is to show that religious people deal easier and better with dangers which can damage mental health. That is noticed through longer lifespan and rare illnesses. However, spirituality is not a guarantee that religious persons will not suffer from mental disorders which can result in mental illnesses and their consequences. Illness usually leads to distorted self-image and the environment which surrounds the patient. Being a religious person does not mean being exempt from illness, but religious persons deal easier with illness and going through the healing process.",NA/NA/2021,"{'Portugal, Liana Catarina Lima': ['NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Laboratory of Neurophysiology of Behavior, Biomedical Institute, Federal Fluminense University, Brazil.']}",Psychiatria Danubina,eng,No keywords,['mental health']
3,33591577,10.1002/hpm.3122,Mental health: The burden of social stigma.,"The burden of mental health has two facets, social and psychological. Social stigma causes individuals who suspect to be suffering from a mental condition to conceal it, importantly by seeking care from a nonspecialist provider willing to diagnose it as physical disease. In this way, social stigma adds to both the direct and indirect cost of mental health. A microeconomic model depicting an individual who searches for an accommodating provider leads to the prediction that individuals undertake more search in response to a higher degree of social stigma. However, this holds only in the absence of errors in decision-making, typically as long as mental impairment is not too serious. While government and employers have an incentive to reduce the burden of social stigma, their efforts therefore need to focus on persons with a degree of mental impairment that still allows them to avoid errors in pursuing their own interest.",05/NA/2021,"{'Mázala-de-Oliveira, Thalita': ['NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil.']}",The International journal of health planning and management,eng,"['concealment', 'mental health', 'nondisclosure', 'search', 'social stigma']",['mental health']

Although the disorder persists into adulthood in half of cases, adult ADHD is often not recognized due to different psychopathological characteristics, quite often overlapping with other diagnoses such as mood, anxiety and personality disorders. This is especially true for bipolar disorder (BD), which shares several symptoms with adult ADHD. Moreover, besides an overlapping clinical presentation, BD is often co-occurring in adults with ADHD, with comorbidity figures as high as 20%. This review will focus on the comorbidity between ADHD and BD by exploring the magnitude of the phenomenon and evaluating the clinical and functional characteristics associated with ADHD-BD comorbidity in adults. Finally, the review will address the implications of pharmacologically treating the ADHD-BD comorbidity, providing suggestions in how to treat these complex patients and addressing the issue of treatment-induced manic switch with the use of stimulants and other medications for ADHD.",05/10/2021,"{'Raony, Ícaro': ['Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil; School of Medicine, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24033-900, Brazil.']}","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",eng,"['ADHD', 'bipolar disorder', 'comorbidity', 'stimulants', 'treatment-induced mania']",['ADHD']

EEG-neurofeedback has been tested for about 45 years, with the latest meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) showing small/medium effects compared to non-active controls only. Three small studies piloted neurofeedback of frontal activations in ADHD using functional magnetic resonance imaging or near-infrared spectroscopy, finding no superior effects over control conditions. Brain stimulation has been applied to ADHD using mostly repetitive transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation (rTMS/tDCS). rTMS has shown mostly negative findings on improving cognition or symptoms. Meta-analyses of tDCS studies targeting mostly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show small effects on cognitive improvements with only two out of three studies showing clinical improvements. Trigeminal nerve stimulation has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms with medium effect in one RCT. Modern neurotherapeutics are attractive due to their relative safety and potential neuroplastic effects. However, they need to be thoroughly tested for clinical and cognitive efficacy across settings and beyond core symptoms and for their potential for individualised treatment.",08/21/2021,"{'Ferreira, Elenn Soares': ['NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil.']}",Cells,eng,"['EEG-neurofeedback', 'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)', 'brain stimulation', 'fMRI-neurofeedback', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)', 'neurofeedback', 'transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)', 'transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)', 'trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS)']",['ADHD']
7,34265320,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.07.010,Alcohol use disorders and ADHD.,"Despite a growing literature on the complex bidirectional relationship of ADHD and substance use, reviews specifically focusing on alcohol are scarce. ADHD and AUD show a significant genetic overlap, including genes involved in gluatamatergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmission. ADHD drives risky behavior and negative experiences throughout the lifespan that subsequently enhance a genetically increased risk for Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD). Impulsive decisions and a maladaptive reward system make individuals with ADHD vulnerable for alcohol use and up to 43 % develop an AUD; in adults with AUD, ADHD occurs in about 20 %, but is vastly under-recognized and under-treated. Thus, routine screening and treatment procedures need to be implemented in AUD treatment. Long-acting stimulants or non-stimulants can be used to treat ADHD in individuals with AUD. However, it is crucial to combine medical treatment for ADHD with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for AUD, and other comorbid disorders. Identification of individuals at risk for AUD, especially those with ADHD and conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, is a key factor to prevent negative outcomes.",09/NA/2021,"{'Giestal-de-Araujo, Elizabeth': ['Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil; National Institute of Science and Technology on Neuroimmunomodulation - INCT-NIM, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.']}",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,eng,"['Adolescence', 'Adults', 'Alcohol-related disorders', 'Binge drinking', 'Genetics', 'Impulsivity', 'Inattention', 'Neurodevelopmental disorders', 'Trauma and stressor related disorders']",['ADHD']

However, no systematic review with meta-analysis has aimed to quantify the degree of comorbidity between both disorders. To this end we performed a systematic search of the literature in October 2020. In a meta-analysis of 71 studies with 646,766 participants from 18 countries, it was found that about one in thirteen adults with ADHD was also diagnosed with BD (7.95 %; 95 % CI: 5.31-11.06), and nearly one in six adults with BD had ADHD (17.11 %; 95 % CI: 13.05-21.59 %). Substantial heterogeneity of comorbidity rates was present, highlighting the importance of contextual factors: Heterogeneity could partially be explained by diagnostic system, sample size and geographical location. Age of BD onset occurred earlier in patients with comorbid ADHD (3.96 years; 95 % CI: 2.65-5.26, p < 0.001). Cultural and methodological differences deserve attention for evaluating diagnostic criteria and clinicians should be aware of the high comorbidity rates to prevent misdiagnosis and provide optimal care for both disorders.",05/NA/2021,"{'Dos Santos, Aline Araujo': ['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Laboratory of Neurochemical Interactions, Biomedical Institute, Federal Fluminense University, Brazil.']}",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,eng,"['ADHD', 'Adult bipolar disorder', 'Age of onset', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Comorbidity', 'Prevalence']",['ADHD']

However, it remains unclear how maternal ADHD could affect pregnancy and birth as well as early mother-(father)-child interaction. There are several studies investigating the effect of depressed or anxious parents on parent-child-interactions in early infancy, but data about the influence of parental ADHD is lacking although it is a common mental disorder in parents. Additionally, the prescription of stimulant and other ADHD medication for adult ADHD patients is rising due to improved diagnostic procedures and a greater awareness of this disorder in adulthood among psychiatrists and psychologists. However, this leads to increased numbers of treated ADHD women that wish to have children or experience unplanned pregnancies while taking stimulant medication. In our systematic review we aimed at analysing the current evidence for the association of maternal ADHD with pregnancy and birth outcomes, pregnancy risks and health behaviour in pregnancy, as well as the association of parental ADHD with early parent-child interaction and early child development in the first 3 years. Furthermore, we reviewed recent evidence on the risks of stimulant and non-stimulant treatment for ADHD in pregnancy and lactation.",05/NA/2021,"{'Bomfim, Priscilla Oliveira-Silva': ['NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil; National Institute of Science and Technology on Neuroimmunomodulation - INCT-NIM, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil; Rio de Janeiro Neuroinflammation Research Network, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.

12,33332004,10.1007/978-3-030-57369-0_5,Cannabis and Depression.,"There is a growing body of evidence pointing to the co-occurrence of cannabis use and depression. There is also some evidence that the use of cannabis may lead to the onset of depression; however, strong evidence points to the inverse association; i.e. that depression may lead to the onset or increase in cannabis use frequency. Observational and epidemiological studies have not indicated a positive long-term effect of cannabis use on the course and outcome of depression. The association between cannabis use and depression may be stronger among men during adolescence and emerging adulthood and stronger in women during midlife. There is an indication for potential genetic correlation contributing to the comorbidity of cannabis dependence and major depression, namely that serotonin (5-HT) may mediate such association and there is also evidence for specific risk alleles for cannabis addiction. There is preclinical evidence that alteration in the endocannabinoid system could potentially benefit patients suffering from depression. However, the issue of using cannabis as an anti-depressant is at an early stage of examination and there is little evidence to support it. Finally, there has been little support to the notion that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be effective in decreasing depressive symptoms or rates of substance use in adolescents treated for depression and a co-occurring substance use disorder. In conclusion, despite methodological limitations, research in the past decades has broadened our knowledge on the association between cannabis use and depression from epidemiological, neurological, genetic, and pharmacological perspectives.",NA/NA/2021,"{'Skoko, Iko': ['University of Mostar, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Matice hrvatske 1, Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina.']}",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,eng,"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cannabis', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental illness', 'Mood disorders']",['depression']
