ABSTRACT
The built environment has direct and indirect effects on mental health.High-
rise housing is inimical to the psychological well-being of women with young children.
Poor-quality housing appears to increase psychological distress, but methodological
issues make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Mental health of psychiatric patients
has been linked to design elements that affect their ability to regulate social interaction
(e.g., furniture configuration, privacy). Alzheimer’s patients adjust better to small-scale,
homier facilities that also have lower levels of stimulation. They are also better ad-
justed in buildings that accommodate physical wandering. Residential crowding (num-
ber of people per room) and loud exterior noise sources (e.g., airports) elevate psycho-
logical distress but do not produce serious mental illness. Malodorous air pollutants
heighten negative affect, and some toxins (e.g., lead, solvents) cause behavioral distur-
bances (e.g., self-regulatory ability, aggression). Insufficient daylight is reliably associ-
ated with increased depressive symptoms.
Indirectly, the physical environment may influence mental health by altering psy-
chosocial processes with known mental health sequelae. Personal control, socially
supportive relationships, and restoration from stress and fatigue are all affected by
properties of the built environment. More prospective, longitudinal studies and, where
feasible, randomized experiments are needed to examine the potential role of the phys-
ical environment in mental health. Even more challenging is the task of developing
underlying models of how the built environment can affect mental health. It is also
likely that some individuals may be more vulnerable to mental health impacts of the
built environment. Because exposure to poor environmental conditions is not ran-
domly distributed and tends to concentrate among the poor and ethnic minorities, we
also need to focus more attention on the health implications of multiple environmental
risk exposure.
Human beings spend more than 90% of their lives indoors,
1 yet we know much
more about ambient environmental conditions and health than we do about the
built environment and health. This article critically analyzes what is known about
the built environment and mental health. The built environment affects mental
health in two major ways. Characteristics of the built environment can directly
influence mental health. Environmental characteristics with direct effects on mental
health include housing, crowding, noise, indoor air quality, and light.
In addition to direct effects, the built environment can indirectly impact mental
health by altering psychosocial processes with known mental health consequences.
For example, higher residential density interferes with the development of socially
supportive relationships within the household. Diminished social support increases

psychological distress. The indirect pathways I examine are personal control, social
support, and restoration. Following discussion of indirect mental health correlates
of the built environment, conceptual challenges and future research needs are out-
lined.
DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH CORRELATES
OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Housing
Most research on housing and health has focused on physical health.
2,3 Nonetheless,
house type (e.g., high-rise), floor level, and housing quality (e.g., structural prob-
lems) have all been linked to mental health.
House Type
Studies on house type converge on the conclusion that high-rise, mul-
tiple dwelling units are inimical to the psychological well-being of mothers with young
children and possibly that of young children themselves.
4–6 These effects seem par-
ticularly pronounced among low-income families. Nearly all of these studies employ
cross-sectional designs with statistical controls for socioeconomic status (SES). They
tend to rely on self-report measures of psychological distress that incorporate sub-
clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression. A small number of studies have taken
advantage of natural experiments in which tenants were randomly assigned to
dwellings.
7–9
Suspected reasons for the link between high-rise housing and psychological dis-
tress are social isolation of mothers and restricted play opportunities for children.
In many high-rise buildings, particularly for low-income families, insufficient re-
sources are allotted to spaces that afford the development and maintenance of social
networks. Lobbies, lounges, and other small-group spaces are absent or located too
far from residences or in public areas that afford insufficient residential control and
feelings of ownership (e.g., public lobby upon entrance). Women in large, high-rise
housing developments report more loneliness and diminished territorial control in
comparison to women of similar backgrounds living in other types of housing.
4,6
Parents of young children in large multiple-dwelling units often cope with the
paucity of nearby play spaces by keeping children inside their apartments. Such
restrictions heighten intrafamilial conflict, minimize play opportunities with others,
and remove a primary avenue for parents to get to know their neighbors.
10,11
Floor Level
Some of the adverse mental health consequences of high-rise housing
may be caused by floor level itself. Families living on higher floors have more men-
tal health problems. However, all of the studies showing this, save one,
7 are cross-
sectional.
4,6 Thus, the potential methodological problem of self-selection bias is a
plausible rival explanation. People with greater preexisting mental health problems
may wind up living on higher floor levels.
Housing Quality
Housing quality, which typically incorporates some aspects of
structural quality, maintenance and upkeep, amenities (e.g., private bath, central
heat), and physical hazards, is positively associated with mental health. Although
there is near consensus on an inverse relationship between housing quality and
psychological distress,
4–6,12 a host of methodological problems plagues this litera-
ture.
538
EVANS
Most housing quality and mental health study designs are cross-sectional, and
too many rely on respondent reports of housing quality. Although many investiga-
tors have employed statistical controls for SES, other “third” variables could be
operating that are not adequately captured by SES controls. In addition, since psy-
chological well-being can affect one’s judgment about environmental quality, some
of the apparent correlation between housing quality and well-being may be spuri-
ous. For example, people who are depressed might rate their housing quality lower
than others not suffering psychological distress. On the other hand, some authors
12–15
have shown that when people move into better housing, their mental health im-
proves in comparison to those who do not move.
Some methodological problems may lead to the opposite bias, causing under-
estimation of housing–mental health relationships. For example, many housing quality
studies have focused on low-income or institutional (e.g., military, college dorms)
populations. Variability in housing quality for such populations is truncated, thus
downwardly biasing estimates of covariation with health outcomes. Furthermore,
housing quality assessment instruments often contain few items, some of which
are dichotomous (e.g., present/absent), and rarely incorporate reliability estimates.
Christenson et al.
16 compared associations between indices of housing quality and
residential satisfaction, demonstrating significant increments in explained variance
(8% to 19%) by improving the reliability of housing quality measurement instru-
ments.
A few explanations for the positive link between housing quality and mental
health have been offered. Insecurity often accompanies poor-quality housing. There
are constant difficulties with repairs and unresponsive landlords. The occupants of
poor-quality housing are often low-income renters who are concerned about hous-
ing tenure. Frequent relocations, which occur more often among people living in
poor-quality housing, are a risk factor for socioemotional problems in children.
17,18
Involuntary relocation negatively affects psychological adjustment among older
19
and middle-aged adults
20 as well. People living in poor-quality housing experience
stigma and may attribute some of their predicament to themselves.
12,21 Parents in
poor housing are more apt to contend with safety hazards including insufficient
safety protection (e.g., smoke detectors, hot water temperature regulators), close proxi-
mity to higher volume street traffic, and a greater number of housing code viola-
tions, all of which contribute to childhood injury rates.
22–25
Neighborhood Quality
When people change houses, they often move to new
neighborhoods as well. Evaluations of three recent experiments with housing voucher
programs for low-income families in the United States, including one with random
assignment, show that relocating from low-income neighborhoods to middle-
income areas is associated with enhanced mental health for both adults and chil-
dren.
26,27
It is difficult to disentangle the quality of the residential unit from the neighbor-
hood context in which the housing is situated. For example, multiple-family dwell-
ings are more likely to be proximate to busy streets.
24 Poor-quality housing is more
likely to be located in neighborhoods with multiple indicators of urban decay.
28,29
There is growing literature demonstrating that neighborhood quality has mental
health impacts on children and their families, independent of household SES.
29,30
Unfortunately, none of these studies specifies physical qualities of neighborhoods,
instead defining neighborhood quality as a bundled index of multiple social (e.g.,
percentage unemployed) and physical attributes (e.g., number of abandoned build-

ings). Recently, Weich et al.
31 found that housing areas with deck access had higher
rates of depression. Deck access residences are multifamily units in which individual
apartments open directly onto open walkways connected to a central staircase.
These walkways are rather public, anonymous spaces with little evidence of residen-
tial social control or ownership.
Institutional Settings
Vulnerable members of society who cannot live on their own may reside in institu-
tional environments. There is a small body of research on design and mental health
among residents of psychiatric facilities and residences for Alzheimer’s patients,
respectively.
Psychiatric Facilities
When furniture is rearranged to promote social interaction
(e.g., chairs facing one another at a comfortable distance, chairs arranged around a
table), social interaction among hospitalized patients increases, and isolated, passive
behaviors decrease.
32–35 Timko
36 showed that better physical amenities in psychiatric
facilities (e.g., hallway decorations, weather protection at entryways) were signifi-
cantly related to multiple indicators of psychological adjustment.
The above institutional studies focused on psychiatric facilities. Zimring et al.
37
had the opportunity to evaluate architectural renovations in a hospital for the devel-
opmentally disabled. Large open sleeping wards that typically accommodated 15
to 20 severely retarded adults were renovated into three different residential de-
signs: suites, small corridors, and open sleeping wards that had modular, partially
(half height) partitioned spaces. The open wards resembled in many respects an open
office design. Improvements (e.g., social interaction, mental alertness) were found
pre- to postconstruction for those living in the suites and corridors, whereas little
change occurred in the partitioned open sleeping ward. Zimring’s data are consis-
tent with prior work showing that the more individuals a psychiatric patient shares
a bedroom with, the greater the amount of social withdrawal.
38 Patients with their
own rooms are better adjusted and more socially engaged.
Alzheimer’s Facilities
Although a new, emerging area of research, there is evidence
that design can make a difference in the well-being of Alzheimer’s patients. Among
the design features best documented with positive mental health outcomes including
less depression, less disorientation, and reductions in behavioral disturbances are the
following: smaller (9–20 residents) versus larger units, reduction in noise levels, use
of simple geometric floor plans, landmarks and good signage, accommodation of
wandering, and provision of noninstitutional, more homelike features.
39 The latter
may be particularly effective if design elements from the historical period matching
the individual’s middle adulthood are incorporated.
40 Unfortunately, nearly all of
these studies suffer from weak research designs, often lacking appropriate controls.
Crowding
Examination of the literature reveals a positive relationship between one index of
crowding, number of people per room, and psychological distress. Indices of crowd-
ing measured in the aggregate such as people per census tract bear little relationship
to mental health outcomes.
41,42 Furthermore, in measuring number of people per
room, it is important to exclude people living alone, since single residence is a well-
documented correlate of mental illness.
The data on number of people per room and psychological distress are consis-

EVANS
tent with the few insignificant findings likely due to truncated range in density and/
or poor measurement of mental health. Experimental studies with random assign-
ment to short-term crowding in the laboratory reveal significant impacts on nega-
tive affect as well as physiological stress.
41,42 Investigations of institutionalized popu-
lations (e.g., prisoners) evidence associations between crowding and psychological
distress.
43 Tripling up of college students also reveals similar trends.
42 One of the
prison studies included longitudinal data, with changes in prison cell density coin-
ciding with fluctuations in well-being.
44 Several residential density studies also re-
veal evidence of a dose-response relationship.
45–47 Furthermore, a prospective, longi-
tudinal study revealed that although residential density was not related to
psychological distress at initial occupancy, 6 months later it was positively related
to elevated psychological distress.
48 Children also evidence adverse mental health
correlates of residential crowding.
42
Noise
Most research on noise and mental health has examined airport noise exposure.
Initial research focused on psychiatric admissions, with early studies supporting a
positive association between aircraft noise exposure and elevated psychiatric admis-
sions. Subsequent work with better controls for socioeconomic status has largely
refuted this earlier literature.
49 There is evidence, however, that community noise
exposure from airports may be associated with less catastrophic indices of psycho-
logical well-being than psychiatric admissions. Unfortunately, most of these studies
on psychological distress are cross-sectional, although many incorporate statistical
controls for SES.
42,49 A study of children exposed to traffic noise from roads and
trains in small towns in Austria generated a dose-response function between noise
and psychological distress.
50 These investigators also uncovered greater adverse im-
pact among children at higher biological risk (e.g., prematurity). One prospective
study with children indicated that 8- to 10-year-olds’ psychological health was ad-
versely impacted by the opening of a new airport.
51 There are also data indicating
dose-response functions between airport noise and use of psychotropic drugs in
adults.
52,53 On the other hand, studies around Heathrow Airport have found more
equivocal data on noise and children’s mental health.
54–56
Indoor Air Quality
Epidemiologists and physicians studying air pollution and health were among the
first to appreciate that environmental problems in the built environment were not
equivalent to outdoor ambient conditions. Chemical properties of building materi-
als themselves can be toxic, and heating and cooking systems affect indoor air
quality. As an illustration, an unvented gas stove raises indoor nitrogen dioxide
concentrations above typical outdoor levels. Building properties (e.g., ventilation,
construction materials) can also alter exposure to ambient pollutants. Ozone levels,
for example, are usually lower indoors than outside.
Malodorous Pollutants
Research on indoor pollutants and mental health has fo-
cused on malodorous substances and various behavioral toxins (e.g., lead, solvents,
pesticides). It is worth brief mention that outdoor ambient pollutants have been
associated with mental health outcomes.
57,58 The evidence includes large cross-
sectional comparisons and longitudinal studies, including some time series analyses.
There is consistent evidence of elevated negative affect under well-controlled labo-
ratory experiments and in field studies of malodorous pollutants.
58–60 Negative be-

541
havioral reactions (e.g., aggression) to pollutants also occur under certain condi-
tions.
58,59
Behavioral Toxins
Most research on behavioral toxins such as heavy metals, pes-
ticides, and solvents has focused on neurological and cognitive impacts.
61 Studies of
cognitive deficits associated with early childhood lead exposure are a prime exam-
ple.
62,63 It is less well appreciated that several of the behavioral toxins, including
lead, also impact psychological well-being. Lead, for example, impedes self-regula-
tory behavior in children (e.g., focused attention, frustration tolerance), which in
turn is related to behavioral conduct disorders such as yelling, fighting, and other
forms of aggression.
62,64 Several other hazardous materials (mercury, manganese,
organic solvents) produce neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, depres-
sion, irritability, and concentration difficulties.
65 Exposure to heavy metals has also
been linked to criminal behavior in adults,
66 but the evidence comes from only a
few correlational studies. Animal toxicological models also reveal evidence of ag-
gression and deficient maternal behavior.
67
Psychological Trauma From Hazardous Exposure
Some behavioral reactions to
toxins are caused by the psychological trauma associated with threats to personal
health. Community members who discover they have been exposed to hazardous
materials reveal multiple indices of psychological distress including fear and panic,
sleep disturbance, feelings of loss of control and helplessness, pessimism and fatal-
ism (particularly with respect to future health), and in some cases posttraumatic
stress disorder.
68,69 Heightened family conflicts are also common.
Light
Despite widespread belief, there is no clear evidence that color affects mood, emo-
tions, or psychological well-being in any systematic manner. There is consistent
evidence on color preferences, but emotional reactions to color are idiosyncratic
and transitory. Levels of illumination, particularly the amount of daylight exposure,
however, impact psychological well-being.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that occurs in relation
to the amount of exposure to daylight.
70 Individuals chronically exposed to shorter
hours of daylight suffer more sadness, fatigue, and, for some, clinical depression.
Patients hospitalized for severe depression recover more quickly in sunny versus
dimly lit rooms.
71 Level of illumination and not spectral frequency is the critical
element in SAD.
72 Insufficient exposure to daylight from windows in a Swedish
study disrupted normal circadian rhythms of cortisol in school children. Distracti-
bility and cooperative social behavior in the classroom were also adversely af-
fected.

are personal control, social support, and restoration. Each of these processes, in
turn, has well-characterized mental health sequelae.
Personal Control
People feel better and have better mental health when they can control their sur-
roundings.
74–76 When opportunities for control over the environment are thwarted,
helplessness can occur. Helplessness is operationalized by exposing subjects to an
uncontrollable stimulus (e.g., noise) while performing a task and then presenting
them with opportunities to avoid a noxious stimulus by performance on either the
same or a different task. In another learned helplessness paradigm, individuals are
exposed to an uncontrollable stimulus, followed by a different task wherein the
aversive stimulus is no longer present. In each case, greater helplessness is indicated
by reduced persistence (giving up) on the subsequent task.
Several studies have directly linked the built environment to helplessness. Labo-
ratory exposure to acute noise,
77–79 crowding,
80–82 and malodorous pollutants

learned helplessness in people. Chronic exposure to community noise
42,51,83–85 reveals
the same patterns of results among elementary school children. Cohen et al.,
83 for
example, found cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence of diminished task persis-
tence on a challenging jigsaw puzzle among third through fifth graders attending
schools in areas affected by airport noise in comparison to children in similar
schools located in quiet neighborhoods. Extensive SES controls were incorporated
in Cohen and colleagues’ work. Bullinger et al.
51 replicated these effects in a pro-
spective, longitudinal study using the opening of a new airport. Acoustical improve-
ments in a noisy preschool building led to greater task persistence.
86 Adults who

manifest greater helplessness in task persistence.
Architecture may impact helplessness as well. College students in dormitories
with long corridor designs manifest multiple indices of helplessness in comparison
to those living in suite arrangements.
90–92 Students were randomly assigned to living
units and the greater the duration of residence, the stronger the impact. Uncontrol-
lable social interaction appears to explain these design effects. High-rise housing
and poor-quality housing have also been associated with more uncontrollable social
interaction.
93,94
Other design features may influence the regulation of social interaction. The
provision of a range of social interaction spaces from small intimate spaces for
solitude, through small group spaces, to larger, more public interaction opportuni-
ties is associated with greater perceived control and comfort in residential set-
tings.
95,96 The size, location, and permeability of interior rooms influence the degree
of social control afforded to residents.
97,98
Territoriality, the ability to monitor and regulate use of space, is related to
the physical environment. Tall, large structures, long interior corridors, lack of
small group spaces, and poor visual surveillance capability (e.g., inability to moni-
tor entrances, places for concealment) interfere with territorial control and feel-
ings of ownership, and are associated with both actual crime levels and fear of
crime.
99–102 Social cohesion among neighbors along with willingness to exert so-
cial control over the behaviors of others constitute collective efficacy. Collective
efficacy is related to actual crime as well as fear of crime.
103 When public housing
residents relocate to middle-class suburban neighborhoods, feelings of mastery in-
crease relative to other public housing residents who relocate to low-income neigh-
borhoods.
104
THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH
545
Social Support
A second indirect pathway potentially linking the built environment to mental
health is social support. A multitude of empirical studies reflect positive relation-
ships between social support and mental health.
105–108 Cross-sectional, prospective,
and longitudinal studies and intervention experiments all converge on this conclu-
sion.
There are multiple ways in which the built environment can influence the devel-
opment and maintenance of socially supportive networks. The probability of social
interaction is greater when entrances to residential units are proximate, face one
another, or are directly connected to major pedestrian paths or meeting areas.
109,110
Social interaction is also promoted inside buildings by proximity (e.g., nearby
offices)
111–113 and by creating focal points. Successful focal points include neutral
territory, visual prospect (i.e., one can see what is happening in the space prior to
making a behavioral commitment to the space), inclusion of activity generators
(e.g., food), and furniture arrangements that encourage social interaction.
111,114 Many
of these same design features also facilitate positive social interaction in outdoor
plazas and social spaces.
115,116
More crowded residential settings (i.e., higher number of people per room)
cause social withdrawal and impair the development and maintenance of socially
supportive relationships. Evidence includes cross-sectional and prospective longitu-
dinal field studies as well as experimental studies in the laboratory.
42,117 There are
also several studies of parent-child interaction indicating more conflict and less
responsive parenting in more crowded homes.
42
Analogous findings have also been uncovered in high-rise housing develop-
ments in comparison to low-rise units or detached homes.
8,93,118,119 Residents on busy
streets, compared to those living on streets with lower traffic volume, are more so-
cially withdrawn and less likely to know their neighbors.
120 All of these studies
incorporated controls for SES.
Irritability and negative affect are increased by exposure to noise both at home
and at work.
121–123 Noise can potentiate the expression of aggression, and people
exposed to noise are significantly less likely to help others in need of assistance.
124
Noise interferes with communication, which is undoubtedly a component of social
support. Pollutants increase negative affect, irritability, and, under some circum-
stances, aggression. No data directly address the relationship between either noise
or pollution exposure and social support, but such pathways are plausible.
Restoration
A third indirect pathway through which the built environment might influence men-
tal health is restoration. Several properties of the physical environment have been
directly linked to recovery from cognitive fatigue and stress. Laboratory and field
studies have demonstrated that exposure to natural elements such as trees, water,
and natural landscapes replenishes cognitive energy. Self-report and cognitive per-
formance data converge on this conclusion.
125–127 Psychophysiological recovery from
experimental and naturalistic stressor exposure is also facilitated by exposure to
natural elements.
128,129 In addition, views of nature
125 and landscape paintings,
129 as
well as indoor plants,
130 are all associated with increased positive affect and com-
fort. Recovery from surgery in a randomized trial was accelerated by hospital win-
dow views of nature,
131 and several studies reveal correlations between rates of
illness and room views of natural landscapes among institutional populations (e.g.,
prisoners).
125,129
546
EVANS
Children in day care settings with greater access to nature are less impulsive and
concentrate better.
132 Wells
133 found similar results for residential access to nature in
a longitudinal study comparing children who relocated. Children with attentional
disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) have fewer behavioral prob-
lems when they spend more time in natural settings.
134 Low-income housing areas
in London with less access to private gardens have higher prevalence of depression,
independent of SES,
31 and public housing residents living adjacent to natural out-
door areas report better adjustment to their living environment, feel safer, and have
more positive affect than others from the same housing development living near
outdoor spaces devoid of nature.
135
Design elements other than nature have the potential to enhance restorative
processes within settings. Architectural features that support fascination, curiosity,
or involuntary attention ought to enhance recovery from mental fatigue. Views of
nature, fireplaces, fountains, aquariums, and animals (e.g., an aviary) as well as
paintings of landscapes and other coherent, tranquil scenes are among the design
elements with the potential to afford restoration.
125,126,136,137 Spaces where people can
briefly get away and be alone may buffer some of the harmful effects of residential
crowding.
138
Summary
Table 2 summarizes indirect connections between the built environment and mental
health, suggesting that control, social support, and restoration may intercede be-
tween the physical environment and mental health. Note that only in a few cases
(e.g., higher density →lower social support →increased psychological distress) has
full mediation been tested.
139,140 Instead, what exists is evidence for the initial link
between the physical environment and the psychosocial mediator on the one hand,
and between the psychosocial process and a mental health outcome on the other. I
summarize in Table 2 evidence for the initial link in the indirect pathway, that is,
correlations between the physical environment and each of these three hypothetical
psychosocial mediators.
CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA
Several methodological challenges face research on the built environment and men-
tal health. These challenges include self-selection (drift) of people into settings, in-
adequate environmental measurement, poor exposure estimation, overreliance on
self-report indicators rather than objective markers of environmental quality, re-
stricted variance in environmental quality, nonlinear relationships between environ-
mental quality and well-being, and the embeddedness of different settings within
one another (e.g., housing within neighborhood). On balance, these different meth-
odological shortcomings do not sum to a readily discernible bias. Some of the prob-
lems (e.g., self-selection) may cause overestimation of the association between the
built environment and mental health, whereas other problems (e.g., inadequate ex-
posure estimation) would bias the results in the opposite direction.
Perhaps the most difficult intellectual challenge facing scholars and policy-
makers interested in the potential role of the built environment in mental health is
the issue of underlying mechanisms or explanatory models. I have offered three
hypothetical, underlying mechanisms: control, social support, and restoration.
Clearly, more thought and analyses are necessary on why and how the physical
environment might affect mental health.

Personal control
Noise
Laboratory and field (including one prospective and one intervention
42, 51, 77–79,
study) show uncontrollable noise can induce helplessness.
83–86
Crowding
Children living in higher density homes (people/room) have greater
42, 80–82, 87–89
learned helplessness. Similar findings among crowded adults in the
laboratory.
Suite vs. corridor
Students in long-corridor dormitories show greater learned helplessness
90–92
than those living in suite designs. Longitudinal, intervention, and
cross-sectional evidence.
Spatial hierarchy
Theoretical but little empirical evidence for claim that providing a
95–96
range of social interaction spaces (i.e., solitude to small group) fosters
better ability to regulate social interaction.
Territoriality
Numerous cross-sectional and a couple of intervention studies show
93–94, 99–102
that multifamily residences that are tall, large, and have few semipri-
vate spaces (e.g., group territory), lead to feelings of lack of control
and are associated with crime.
Social support
Distance
Physical proximity increases unplanned social interaction. Functional op-
109–113
portunities for interaction (e.g., doorway opening, proximity to pedes-
trian pathway) also afford greater social interaction.
Crowding
Laboratory and field (cross-sectional and prospective) data reveal that
42, 117
higher density causes social withdrawal and the deterioration of so-
cially supportive relationships.
Housing
High-rise housing and residence on high-traffic volume streets is associ-
8, 93, 118–120
ated with less interaction with neighbors. Cross-sectional data only.
Restoration and recovery
Natural elements
Laboratory, field, and intervention studies converge on nature reducing
125–135
from cognitive fatigue and
stress and diminishing cognitive fatigue.

Architecture
Design elements other than nature may have similar capabilities. Sa-

tranquil stimuli. Primarily theoretical arguments with little data.

Another challenge is moderator effects. Nearly all of the empirical data re-
viewed report overall effects of a particular characteristic of the built environment
(e.g., light) on some indicator of mental health. Yet we know that in many cases there
is likely to be variability in individual reactions to the built environment. There is
a dearth of information on this topic. Women, particularly low-income women with
young children, may be more vulnerable to adverse psychological consequences of
housing.
4,6 The link between residential crowding and helplessness appears to be
stronger in female than male children.
42 Qualities of the physical environment can
also interact with the social environment as they influence mental health. The nega-
tive effects of housing quality,
141 residential crowding,
142,143 noise,
144 and air qual-
ity
145 on psychological health are all exacerbated by the presence of other social
stressors such as family turmoil or interpersonal loss. Individuals already facing
psychosocial stressors are more psychologically vulnerable to suboptimal environ-
mental conditions.
In my discussion of housing quality and mental health, I briefly noted that low-
quality housing is frequently embedded within distressed neighborhoods and thus
presents methodological challenges to disentangle the source of mental health im-
pacts. Some aspects of this issue have been addressed by studies examining the
interaction of housing quality and neighborhood quality on mental health. Psycho-
logical distress in relation to inadequate housing is exacerbated among those living
in more distressed neighborhoods.
146,147 The negative association between residential
crowding and mental health appears stronger among those residing in multifamily
dwellings relative to single family or row houses.
148 Crowded families living on
higher floors of multifamily dwellings do worse than crowded families residing on
lower floors.
149,150 The well-documented relationship between crowding and nega-
tive emotional reactions is exacerbated by high temperatures.
151 Children from more
crowded homes manifest more behavioral problems in crowded day care centers
than children in crowded day care centers who live in uncrowded homes.
152 Finally,
adults living in crowded residences in high-density neighborhoods manifest more
psychological distress than adults living in crowded residences situated in low-den-
sity neighborhoods.
153 Each of these studies demonstrates that exposure to multiple
adverse physical and social conditions can combine to yield more negative mental
health outcomes compared to exposure to individual environmental stressors.
Another important conceptual and analytic challenge in studying mental health
and the built environment is socioeconomic status. Traditionally, SES has been treated
as a confounding variable, requiring control in order to pinpoint the role of envi-
ronmental risks in health. This view can be challenged in at least two respects. First,
the natural ecology of environmental risk is strongly affected by SES. There is abun-
dant evidence of environmental injustice showing that the poor and ethnic minori-
ties are disproportionately likely to reside, attend work or school, and recreate in
suboptimal environments relative to their more affluent counterparts.
28,154 Second,
cumulative social and environmental risk factors have substantially greater impact
on health than singular risk factors.
155,156 Moreover, the harmful impacts of poverty
on health may be conveyed by cumulative environmental risk exposure.
157 Thus the
assessment of singular environmental risk factors is both nonrepresentative and
likely underestimates the health consequences of poor environmental quality.
Obviously, researchers need more investigation with stronger research designs
that incorporate good exposure measurement, ideally over time, and rely on appro-
priate indicators of psychological well-being. However, at this nascent stage of
scholarship on the built environment and mental health, the most pressing need is
THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH
549
better understanding of the psychosocial and biological processes that underlie the
pathways potentially linking the built environment to mental health. Such an under-
standing would enable consideration of the most salient dimensions of the built
environment along with contextual factors to be incorporated into more ecologi-
cally valid models of the built environment and mental health.

Mental Health
George E. Vaillant, M.D.
Objective: Only in the last 30 years has
psychiatry begun to develop empirical
approaches to conceptualizing and as-
sessing positive mental health. Six models
of mental health are reviewed here.
Method: The author points out pitfalls in
research on mental health, e.g., equating
average with healthy, failing to distinguish
trait from state, overlooking cultural
norms, and conversely, blindly accepting
the culture’s values. He describes the six
models and provides history and research
needs for each.
Results: The first model, being “above
normal,” is epitomized by DSM-IV’s axis V,
the Global Assessment of Functioning
Scale. High scores represent “superior
functioning in a wide range of activities,
life’s problems never seem to get out of
hand, is sought out by others because of
his or her many positive qualities.” The
goal of the second model, positive psy-
chology, is intervention to maximize posi-
tive qualities, such as self-efficacy. Maturity
and Erikson’s four developmental tasks
(identity, intimacy, generativity, integrity)
are the basis of the third model. The au-
thor adds two other tasks: career consoli-
dation and “keeper of the meaning.” The
fourth model is emotional or social intelli-
gence, the ability to read other people’s
emotions. Surprisingly, subjective well-be-
ing, the fifth model, is as much a charac-
teristic of temperament as of a benign en-
vironment. The last model, resilience, is
epitomized by DSM-IV’s Defense Function
Scale, which categorizes coping mecha-
nisms in terms of adaptational value.
Conclusions: As with the blind men and
the elephant, each model describes only
some aspects of mental health. Further
research may reveal the contribution of
each.
(Am J Psychiatry 2003; 160:1373–1384)
We cannot even really know what causes neurotic
suffering until we have an idea of what causes real
health. This we have only begun to investigate.
—Erik Erikson (1, p. 93)
T
oo often, psychiatry has been preoccupied only with
mental illness. To paraphrase Mark Twain’s quip about the
weather, psychiatry is always talking about mental health,
but nobody ever does anything about it. Mental illness, af-
ter all, is a condition that can be reliably defined, and its
limits are relatively clear. In contrast, mental health seems
to lie more in the domain of value judgment than of sci-
ence. For example, mental illness can be defined as the
presence of selected symptoms, but mental health is
something more than the absence of symptoms. With the
notable exception of the chapter by Offer and Sabshin in
the third and fourth editions of Comprehensive Textbook of
Psychiatry (2), recent major psychiatric textbooks reveal
virtually no serious discussion of positive mental health.
An electronic search of Psychological Abstracts since 1987
turned up 57,800 articles on anxiety and 70,856 on depres-
sion, but only 5,701 mentioned life satisfaction and only
851 mentioned joy (3).
But mental health is too important to be ignored. In 1978
the report to the President by the President’s Commission
on Mental Health (4) forcefully reiterated the importance
of clearly defining what is meant by mental health, and
over the last 30 years research has slowly moved the study
of mental health from pious platitude toward science.
Finally, 10 years ago, when evidence (5) emerged to sup-
port the validity of axis V (the Global Assessment of Func-
tioning [GAF] Scale) in DSM-IV (p. 32), psychiatry actually
possessed a metric for the measurement of mental health.
Previously, there had been an implicit assumption that
mental health could be best defined as the antonym of
mental illness, but accepting that assumption is to under-
estimate human potential. Starting early in the last cen-
tury, internists, as they recognized that health was more
than an absence of symptoms, began studying high-alti-
tude physiology and developed measures of positive phys-
ical health for athletes, pilots, and finally astronauts. Thus,
the antonym of physical illness is physical fitness. In the
late 1930s, Arlie Bock, an internist trained in high-altitude
physiology and interested in positive physical health, be-
gan at Harvard the Study of Adult Development, an inter-
disciplinary study of both positive mental and physical
health (6, 7). The results of that study, lasting for 60 years
(8), inform many facets of this paper.
It must be admitted that above average mental health is
more difficult to define than physical fitness. Nevertheless,
it is important for psychiatry to emulate sports medicine
and to provide precise definitions and measures of positive
1374

mental health. Psychologists, like physiologists, have
learned to quantify not only normal but better than aver-
age intelligence. Thus, we regard the antonym of mental
retardation not as an IQ of 100 but as an IQ over 130. Psy-
chiatry must follow suit. For rather than merely deciding
who is too sick for a job, psychiatrists are called on to make
decisions about who is mentally healthy enough for certain
positions—such as air traffic controllers and submariners.
Before positive mental health can be defined, several
cautionary steps are necessary. The first step in discussing
mental health is to note that average is not the same as
healthy, for average always includes mixing in with the
healthy the prevalent amount of psychopathology. For ex-
ample, in the general population the mean weight or eye-
sight is actually unhealthy, and if all sources of biopsycho-
social pathology were excluded from the population, the
average IQ would be significantly above 100. Put differ-
ently, being at the center of a normal bell curve of distribu-
tion may or may not be healthy. In the case of red blood
cell count, body temperature, or mood, the middle of the
bell curve is healthy. In the case of eyesight, exercise toler-
ance, or empathy, only the upper end of the bell curve is
healthy; in the case of serum cholesterol, bilirubin, and
narcissism, only the low end of the curve is healthy.
A second cautionary step in discussing mental health is
to appreciate the caveat that what is healthy sometimes
depends on geography, culture, and the historical mo-
ment. Punctuality is a virtue in some countries and a fail-
ing in others. General George Patton’s competitive tem-
perament was a psychological liability in time of peace but
a virtue in two world wars.
A third cautionary step is to make clear whether one is
discussing trait or state. Who is physically healthier: an
Olympic miler disabled by a simple but temporary (state)
ankle fracture or a type 1 diabetic (trait) with a temporarily
normal blood sugar level?
In defining mental health, the fourth and most impor-
tant cautionary step is to appreciate the two-fold danger
of “contamination by values.” On the one hand, cultural
anthropology teaches us how parochial a given culture’s
definition of mental health can be. And, even if mental
health is “good,” what is it good for? The self or the society?
For fitting in or for creativity? For happiness or survival?
And who should be the judge? As Erikson warned, “The
healthy personality is a topic approaching which the ex-
pert becomes a fearful angel” (1, p. 92).
On the other hand, common sense must prevail. Biology
trumps anthropology. Every culture differs in its diet, but
the World Health Organization would be in error to ignore
the universal importance to diet of vitamins and of the
four basic food groups. Although almost no form of behav-
ior is considered abnormal in all cultures, that does not
mean that the tolerated behavior is mentally healthy. Just
because colonial America did not recognize alcoholism as
an illness does not mean that alcoholism contributed less
to 18th-century morbidity.
This article will contrast six different empirical ap-
proaches to mental health. It is significant that the empir-
ical underpinnings for each of the six models have
emerged only recently. First, mental health can be concep-
tualized as above normal, a mental state that is objectively
desirable—as in the capacity to work and to love. Second,
mental health can be conceptualized as positive psychol-
ogy, an early example of which was Maslow’s “self-actual-
izing” individual (9). Third, from the viewpoint of healthy
adult development, mental health can be conceptualized
as maturity. Fourth, mental health can be conceptualized
as emotional or social intelligence. Fifth, mental health can
be conceptualized as subjective well-being—a mental
state that is subjectively experienced as happy, contented,
and desired. Finally, mental health can be conceptualized
as resilience, as in successful adaptation and homeostasis.
A moment’s reflection reveals that each of these models
describes only part of the “elephant” of mental health.
One research agenda must be empirically to decide, by
means of multivariate modeling, which facets of each
model are additive.
Model A: Mental Health 
as Above Normal
In 1835 Adolphe Quetelet published what appears to be
the first important book on normality (10). Rather than fo-
cus on pathology, he tried “to approach more closely to
what is good and beautiful” (p. x), and his goal was the sta-
tistical analysis of healthy humans. He challenged genera-
tions of future investigators with his introductory sen-
tence, “Man is born, grows up, and dies, according to
certain laws which have never been properly investigated”
(p. 5).
Until World War II, however, Quetelet’s challenge to
mental health professionals went largely unheeded. When
in 1941 the U.S. draft board asked health professionals to
define 1-A mental health, they were assigning a novel task.
Indeed, it was not until after World War II that tentative
works on normal adaptive behavior began to be pub-
lished—White’s Lives in Progress (11), Srole and associates’
Mental Health in the Metropolis (12), Erikson’s “Growth
and Crises of the ‘Healthy Personality’” (1), the Stirling
County studies by the Leightons and colleagues (13, 14),
and Grinker and Spiegel’s Men Under Stress (15). Such
studies concentrated on the adaptation of nonpatient or
normal populations but from different vantage points.
Nevertheless, many distinguished postwar psychiatrists
continued to agree with Freud, who had dismissed mental
health as “an ideal fiction.” In the late 1950s Lewis wrote,
“Mental health is an invincibly obscure concept” (16, p.
227), and Redlich asserted, “We do not possess any general
definition of normality and mental health from either a
statistical or a clinical viewpoint” (17).
Shortly thereafter, Jahoda’s report to the Joint Commis-
sion on Mental Illness and Health led to a psychiatric sea

http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org
change regarding the existence of mental health (18). As il-
lustrated in Figure 1, Jahoda suggested that a mentally
healthy individual should 1) be in touch with his or her
own identity and feelings, 2) be oriented toward the future
and remain fruitfully invested in life, 3) have a psyche that
provides resistance to stress, 4) possess autonomy, per-
ceive reality without distortion, and yet possess empathy,
and 5) be able to work, to love, to play, and to be efficient
in problem solving. Although the purpose of Jahoda’s re-
port was to rid the term “mental health” of “vague, elusive
and ambiguous connotation,” Jahoda could not marshal
empirical evidence to prove that her plausible definition
was more than platitude.
In the 1960s, beginning with Grinker and associates’
studies of “homoclites” (22) (physical education majors
selected for normality) and Offer and Sabshin’s text on
normality (19), investigators began to study mental health
empirically. Although data from the Terman Study at Stan-
ford (23), the Institute of Human Development at Berkeley
(24, 25), and the Study of Adult Development at Harvard
(7, 8) were later to be highly informative, the first longitu-
dinal study of positive mental health to be harvested was
arguably the elimination process by which out of 130
healthy jet pilots, already winnowed for over a decade for
psychological resilience, the seven original astronauts
were selected (26). This study underscored both the
importance and the commonsensical nature of mental
health. The final seven astronauts not only enjoyed exem-
plary work records but were also competent at loving. All
had come from intact, happy, small-town families. In their
30s, they all were married with children. Although ven-
turesome test pilots, they had suffered unusually few acci-

dents during their years as pilots or even earlier. They
could tolerate both close interdependent association and
extreme isolation. They trusted others and were uncom-
plaining under discomfort. Emotions, both negative and
positive, were strongly experienced. Not introspective, the
astronauts seldom dwelled on their inner emotions; but
they could describe them when asked. They were aware of
the feelings of others, and they avoided interpersonal dif-
ficulties. Their group score on the neuroticism scale of the
Maudsley Personality Inventory has been described as the
lowest of any group reported in the literature (27).
A more influential early study of mental health was the
Menninger Psychotherapy Project (28). To assess the psy-
chological functioning of study subjects, Menninger psy-
chologist Lester Luborsky devised an empirical measure
of mental health (Health-Sickness Rating Scale), a scale of
0–100 (29, 30). In 1976, because Luborsky’s scale had been
designed to evaluate candidates for psychotherapy rather
than for general epidemiological studies, two of the archi-
tects of DSM-III modified the Health-Sickness Rating
Scale and rechristened it the Global Assessment Scale
(GAS) (31). The reliability values for between-rater agree-
ment on each instrument and agreement between the two
instruments were 0.85 to 0.95 (5). In a cross-cultural com-
parison Armelius and co-workers (32) noted that “the use-
fulness of the Health-Sickness Rating Scale as an interna-
tional thermometer of mental health is strongly
supported.” A modified version of the GAS was introduced
in DSM-III-R as the GAF Scale, or axis V.
As with excellence in the decathlon, no single measure
defines mental health, but all measures are highly inter-
correlated. On the Health-Sickness Rating Scale a score of
95–100 reflects “an ideal state of complete functioning in-
tegration, of resiliency in the face of stress, of happiness
and social effectiveness.” On the DSM-IV GAF Scale, a
score of 91–100 equals “superior functioning in a wide
range of activities, life’s problems never seem to get out of
hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many
positive qualities; no symptoms.” The words differ, but the
melody is the same. Figure 1 illustrates how multifaceted
and unique models of positive mental health can be and
yet how strong their “family” resemblance.
Some items on a future research agenda seem clear.
First, it behooves psychiatry to pursue cross-cultural vali-
dation and refinement of the GAF Scale. Second, since pri-
mary prevention is clearly superior to treating disease
once it has occurred, we need to study individuals with
positive mental health the way that agronomists study
wheat that is resistant to drought and blight. Third, the
concept of mental health raises the issue of therapeutic in-
terventions to achieve it. Which facets of mental health are
fixed and which are susceptible to change? By analogy, in
most individuals the most intensive educational interven-
tion will raise IQ only about 7 points, but sustained thera-
peutic intervention can change individuals utterly illiter-
ate in Italian into fluent Italian conversationalists. With
clozapine or with cognitive behavior therapy we can raise
a GAF Scale score from 40 to 70, but how would we raise a
score from 70 to 90? This is an important research ques-
tion that psychiatry has not yet begun to address.
Model B: Mental Health 
as Positive Psychology
The second model, as old as Aristotle, conceives of men-
tal health as a utopian ideal and has provided the impetus
for the recent positive psychology movement (33). In the
19th century mental health was viewed as related to mo-
rality. Psychiatrists wrote of both “moral insanity” and
“good character.” But in the 20th century, as psychiatry be-
came more concerned with pathology, only educational
psychology remained interested in character and “virtue.”
In psychology, interventions to improve already ade-
quate intelligence and social skills are common, while in
medicine and psychiatry to meddle with adequate thyroid
function, a healthy hematocrit, or a normal mood is only
to invite trouble. It can be argued that in the healthy rested
individual virtually all psychopharmacological interven-
tions will, over time, make the brain function worse; it can
also be argued that many nonpharmacological interven-
tions (e.g., literacy training, stress management, and ten-
nis lessons) will make the brain function better. Thus,
those with the medical goal of using medication to remove
pathology sometimes forget educational interventions to
enhance above average functioning.
Over the last 40 years, Maslow’s concept of self-actual-
ization and his emphasis on humanistic psychology (9, 34)
have drawn attention to full use and exploitation of tal-
ents, capacities, potentialities. But until very recently,
such humanistic psychology did not provide empirical re-
search and ignored both predictive validity and follow-up.
As early as 1925, psychiatrist Adolf Meyer was already
warning psychologists of the difference between “moraliz-
ing” about mental health and studying it by “conscien-
tious and impartial study” and “constructive experimen-
tation” (35, p. 118).
Recently, Seligman (36, 37) has served notice that posi-
tive psychology will follow Meyer’s rules of conscientious
and impartial study and constructive experimentation.
Seligman’s concept of learned optimism incorporates the
empirical advances in cognitive psychology that have
taken place over the past three decades. Creating a posi-
tive attributional style not only serves as a cognitive be-
havior treatment for depression (36, 37) but can lead to
positive mental states.
Advocates of positive psychology wish to learn how to
build the qualities that help individuals and communities
not just to endure and survive but also to flourish. For-
mally introduced in the January 2000 issue of American
Psychologist, positive psychology entails rendering “hu-
manistic” psychology amenable to scientific study and
intervention.

At the individual level, it is about positive individual
traits; the capacity for love and vocation, courage, in-
terpersonal skill, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance,
forgiveness, originality, future mindedness, spiritual-
ity, high talent, and wisdom.… And in this quest for
what is best, positive psychology does not rely on
wishful thinking, faith, self-deception, fads, or hand
waving; it tries to adapt what is best in the scientific
method to the unique problems that human behavior
presents to those who wish to understand it in all its
complexity. (33, p. 5)
Recently, advocates of positive psychology have divided
positive mental health into four components: talents, en-
ablers, strengths, and outcomes (20). Talents are inborn,
are genetic, and are not much affected by intervention
(e.g., high IQ, being an easy baby). Enablers reflect social
interventions and environmental good luck (e.g., strong
family, good school system); these can be experimentally
modified to enhance strengths. Strengths (Figure 1) are
character traits such as curiosity and openness that reflect
facets of mental health that are amenable to change. Out-
comes reflect dependent variables (e.g., improved score on
the GAF Scale, positive social relationships, subjective
well-being) that can be used to provide evidence that clini-
cians’ efforts to alter strengths are not just wishful thinking.
As components of mental health, the specific ideal
strengths (or virtues) are subject to debate. Wisdom, kind-
ness, and the capacity to love and be loved are strengths
over which few would argue. But should courage be in-
cluded as a strength, and why were intelligence, perfect
musical pitch, and punctuality excluded? The answer is
that the 24 strengths listed in Figure 1 may be subjected to
a variety of tests. First, they have been recurrent positive
values across cultures and across centuries. Second, they
may be valued in their own right and not just as a means to
ends.
There are pitfalls with positive psychology. First, the
perspective of mental health as Utopia is one of the bogey-
men of national health policy makers. They are afraid,
without directly expressing it, that this perspective, com-
monly adhered to by some mental health specialists, will
put a backbreaking burden on health insurance. Is helping
people to become happier with themselves a process that
any health insurance program should be expected to
cover? Over time society will have to decide who should
pay for positive mental health: the individual, the educa-
tional system, third-party payers, religious organizations,
or a combination of all four.
A second caution about positive psychology relates to
the danger of the culturally insensitive prescription of pa-
rochial virtues. The dangers of value judgments are enor-
mous. We need to distinguish virtues, even Aristotelian
virtues, from health. Keeping wounds clean is healthy but
not a virtue. Body hygiene in public places is a virtue but
not necessarily healthy.
A third controversial facet of positive psychology is its
emphasis on optimism. Since the late 19th century, many
social scientists, especially those in Europe, have mis-
trusted optimistic cognition, especially religious opti-
mism, as a maladaptive “American” illusion interfering
with accurate perception of reality. Nietzsche, Freud,
Marx, and Darwin all perceived optimism as evidence of
an ingenuous cultural adolescence, not of mature mental
health. It is healthier to face the hard facts of life. Besides,
there is a significant body of work suggesting that the de-
pressed perceive the world more accurately (38).
Nevertheless, over the past 30 years cognitive therapists
have demonstrated that altered cognition can not only
change behavior, it can also alter brain function (39). If pes-
simism is the dominant cognition of the depressed, opti-
mism appears the dominant cognition of the mentally
healthy. If learned helplessness leads to depression, learned
optimism and self-efficacy lead to mental health (37).
In part, the importance of optimism to positive mental
health depends on an explanatory style that asserts, “The
good things that happen to me will last forever. They are
pervasive, and they are my own doing. The bad things that
happen to me occur by chance, are limited, and are un-
likely to happen again.” The explanatory style of many
chronically depressed individuals is just the opposite (40,
41). In addition, optimism includes hope, a facet of mental
health as old as the Greek myth of Pandora. Yet hope is a
topic to which psychiatry up to now has given little formal
consideration. In addition, the illusion of optimism per-
mits one to contemplate and plan for, rather than to deny,
the future. Longitudinal studies have repeatedly shown fu-
ture-mindedness to be a critical ingredient of mental
health (7, 24). Finally, positive psychology is the only
model of mental health that suggests, even tentatively,
how a GAF Scale score of 75 might be raised to 90. The re-
search agenda for positive psychology includes continu-
ing to build bridges to medicine and to build on work (42)
that undergirds such humanistic ideas with Meyer’s “con-
structive experimentation.”
Model C: Mental Health as Maturity
Unlike organs of the body that are designed to stay the
same, the brain is designed to be plastic. A 10-year-old’s
lungs and kidneys are more likely to reflect health than
those of a 50-year-old, but that is not true of the central
nervous system (CNS). To some extent, then, adult men-
tal health reflects a continuing process of maturational
unfolding.
It may be argued that the “brain” gets worse with age, so
why should the “mind” get better? But research reveals
that in the absence of disease the brain works surprisingly
well until age 80 (43) and that neurologically optimal brain
development requires almost a lifetime (44, 45). Prospec-
tive studies reveal that individuals are less depressed and
show greater emotional modulation at 70 than they did at
30 (8, 25).

http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org
Erikson, influenced by his work at the Institute of Hu-
man Development, provided the first model of adult social
development (1, 46). Although he devoted only four out of
55 pages to his three stages of adult development, he saw
each of his eight developmental stages as a “criterion of
mental health” (1, p. 142). Later, Jane Loevinger provided a
model of adult ego development (47), Lawrence Kohlberg
proposed a model of adult moral development (48), and
James Fowler described a model of spiritual development
(49). Implicit in all these models is the assumption that
greater maturity reflects greater mental health. Perhaps
the best definition of mental health that we have is Will-
iam Menninger’s definition of maturity (21) (Figure 1). In
this model maturity is not only the antonym of narcissism
but is quite congruent with other models of mental health.
To confirm the hypothesis that maturity and positive
mental health are almost synonymous, the study of the
behavior and feeling states of persons over a lifetime be-
comes necessary. Although most such longitudinal studies
have come to fruition relatively recently (7, 23, 25, 50, 51),
all illustrate the association of increasing mental health
with maturity. (After age 50, of course, the association
between mental health and maturity is contingent on a
healthy CNS. The ravages of brain trauma, major depres-
sion, arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, alcoholism, and
schizophrenia can all reverse the process.)
The association of mental health with maturity is prob-
ably mediated not only by progressive brain myelinization
(44, 45) but also by the evolution of emotional and social
intelligence over time. Erikson conceptualized such devel-
opment as a “widening social radius.” In his view, life after
age 50 is no longer a staircase leading downward, as in the
Pennsylvania Dutch cartoons of life span development.
Rather, Eriksonian development can be conceptualized as
expanding ripples in a pond. Over time the adult social ra-
dius expands through the mastery of four tasks: identity
versus identity diffusion, intimacy versus isolation, gener-
ativity versus stagnation, and integrity versus despair. On
the basis of empirical data from Harvard’s Study of Adult
Development, I have added two more tasks—career con-
solidation and “keeper of the meaning”—to Erikson’s four
(52) (Figure 2) and demonstrated their sequential nature.
Mastery of such tasks appears relatively independent of
education, gender, social class, and arguably, culture (53).
In such a model the social radius of each adult develop-
mental task fits inside the next. First, the adolescent must
evolve an identity that allows him or her to become sepa-
rate from the parents, for mental health and adult devel-
opment cannot evolve through a false self. The task of
identity requires mastering the last task of childhood: sus-
tained separation from social, residential, economic, and
ideological dependence on one’s family of origin. Such
separation derives as much from the identification and in-
ternalization of important adolescent friends and mentors
as it does from simple biologic maturation (54). For exam-
ple, our accents become relatively fixed by age 16 and re-
flect those of our adolescent peer group rather than the
accents of our parents.
Then adults develop intimacy, which permits them to
become reciprocally, and not narcissistically, involved
with a partner. To many young adults, to live with one
other person in an interdependent, reciprocal, commit-
ted, and contented fashion for years and years may seem
neither desirable nor possible. Once achieved, however,
the capacity for intimacy may seem as effortless and desir-
able as riding a bicycle. Sometimes the relationship is with
a person of the same gender; sometimes it is completely
asexual; and sometimes, as in religious orders, the inter-
dependence is with a community. In different cultures and
epochs, mastery of intimacy has taken very different
guises but “mating for life” and “marriage-type love” are
tasks built into the developmental repertoires of many
warm-blooded species, including our own.
Career consolidation is a task that is usually mastered
together with or that follows the mastery of intimacy. Mas-
tery of this task permits adults to find a career as valuable
as they once found play. On a desert island one can have a
hobby but not a career, for careers involve being of value
to other people. There are four crucial developmental cri-
teria that transform a job or hobby into a career: content-
ment, compensation, competence, and commitment. Not
only people with schizophrenia but also individuals with
severe personality disorder often manifest a lifelong in-
ability to achieve either intimacy or sustained, gratifying
employment. Such individuals rarely enjoy a GAF Scale
score over 65.
Mastery of the fourth task, generativity, involves the
demonstration of a clear capacity to unselfishly care for

and guide the next generation. Existing research reveals
that sometime between ages 35 and 55 our need for
achievement declines and our need for community and
affiliation increases (55). Depending on the opportunities
that the society makes available, generativity can mean
serving as a consultant, guide, mentor, or coach to young
adults in the larger society. Generativity reflects the capac-
ity to give the self—finally completed through mastery of
the first three tasks of adult development—away. Its mas-
tery is strongly correlated with subsequent mental health
in old age (8). For in old age there are inevitable losses, and
these may overwhelm us if we have not continued to grow
beyond our immediate family.
The penultimate life task is to become a keeper of the
meaning. Like grandparenthood, this task involves passing
on the traditions of the past to the future. Generativity and
its virtue, care, require taking care of one person rather
than another. Keeper of the meaning and its virtues of wis-
dom and justice are less selective; for justice, unlike care,
means not taking sides. The focus of a keeper of the mean-
ing is with conservation and preservation of the collective
products of mankind—the culture in which one lives and
its institutions—rather than with just the development of
its children. Clearly, caretakers and grandparents are not
mentally healthier than caregivers and parents. The dis-
tinction is only that grandparents are usually better at the
tasks of keeper of the meaning than are 30-year-olds.
Finally, in old age it is common to feel that some life ex-
ists after death and that one is part of something greater
than one’s community. Thus, the last life task is integrity,
the task of achieving some sense of peace and unity with
respect to one’s own life. One’s social radius may expand to
embrace the whole world. Erikson described integrity as
an experience that conveys some world order and spiritual
sense. “It is the acceptance of one’s one and only life cycle
and of the people who have become significant to it as
something that had to be and that, by necessity, permitted
of no substitutions” (1, p. 143).
Of course, healthy adult development does not follow
rigid rules, nor are butterflies healthier than caterpillars.
Some individuals, often because of great stress, tackle de-
velopmental tasks out of order or all at once. Beethoven
enjoyed a brilliant committed career but never enjoyed
intimacy.
The research agenda for the maturational model is the
same as for positive psychology—to provide such human-
istic concepts of adult development with more opera-
tional, empirically grounded, prospectively derived, and
cross-culturally validated definitions of maturational
tasks and then to demonstrate their predictive validity.
Model D: Mental Health 
as Social-Emotional Intelligence
In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defined social-
emotional intelligence as follows: “Anyone can become
angry—that is easy. But to be angry with the right person,
to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose,
and in the right way—that is not easy.” Nevertheless, as re-
cently as 40 years ago a textbook on intelligence dismissed
the concept of social intelligence as “useless.” Indeed, only
since the 1970s has modulation of “object relations”
seemed more important to psychoanalysis than modula-
tion of “instinct.”
The benefits of being able to read feelings from nonver-
bal cues have been demonstrated in almost a score of
countries (56). These benefits include being better emo-
tionally adjusted, more popular, and more responsive to
others. Empathic children, without being more intelli-
gent, do better in school and are more popular than their
peers. Head Start found that early school success was
achieved not by intelligence but by being able to wait and
knowing what kind of behavior is expected, how to rein in
the impulse to misbehave, and how to get on with other
children (57).
Social-emotional intelligence can be defined by the fol-
lowing criteria (56):
1. Accurate conscious perception and monitoring of
one’s own emotions.
2. Modification of one’s emotions so that their expres-
sion is appropriate. This involves the capacity to self-
soothe anxiety and to shake off hopelessness and
gloom.
3. Accurate recognition of and response to emotions in
others.
4. Skill in negotiating close relationships with others.
5. Capacity for focusing emotions (motivation) on a de-
sired goal. This involves delayed gratification and
adaptively displacing and channeling impulse.
Over the last 15 years, two important empirical steps
have been taken in our understanding of the importance
of social-emotional intelligence to positive mental health.
The first step is that both functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and ingenious neurophysiological experi-
mentation (58, 59) have led to advances in our under-
standing of the integration of the prefrontal cortex with
the limbic system, especially with the amygdala and its
connections. This in turn has brought us closer to under-
standing emotions as neurophysiological phenomena
rather than as platonic abstractions.
The second step has been our slow but steady progress
in conceptualizing and even measuring “emotional intelli-
gence” (60). High emotional intelligence reflects above av-
erage mental health in the same way that a high IQ reflects
above average intellectual aptitude. Gardner described
emotional intelligence as the capacity to “discern and re-
spond appropriately to the moods, temperaments, moti-
vations and desires of other people” (61, p. 8).
Where the study of positive mental health ends and pri-
mary prevention begins is unclear, but like the model of
positive psychology, the model of social-emotional intelli-
1380
Am J Psychiatry 160:8, August 2003
MENTAL HEALTH
http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org
gence is potentially interventionist. Just as we can have
above average musical skill or physical coordination and
yet can train these strengths to be even greater; so we are
learning to enhance emotional intelligence. There are al-
ready exercises in teaching emotion recognition and dif-
ferentiation to patients with eating disorders and teaching
anger modulation and how to find creative solutions to so-
cial predicaments for individuals with behavior disorders.
Once we have a firmer grasp of its measurement, the rela-
tive importance of emotional intelligence to other compo-
nents of mental health can be assessed. I wager that it will
emerge as the most important single dimension of mental
health.
Model E: Mental Health 
as Subjective Well-Being
Is it better to meet some expert’s definition of mental
health, or is it better to feel subjectively fulfilled? The an-
swer is “both.” For positive mental health does not involve
just being a joy to others; one must also experience subjec-
tive well-being. Indeed, long before humankind consid-
ered definitions of mental health, they pondered criteria
for subjective happiness. “No man is happy who does not
think himself so.”
Nevertheless, the mental health issues involved in sub-
jective well-being are complicated and clouded by histori-
cal relativism, value judgment, and illusion. As already
noted, Europeans have been skeptical of American con-
cern with happiness. On the one hand, happiness that
comes from joy or unselfish love (agape), that comes from
self-control and self-efficacy, or that comes from play or
deep but effortless involvement (62) reflects health. On
the other hand, happiness can be based on illusion or on
dissociative states, and the search for happiness can ap-
pear selfish, narcissistic, superficial, and banal. Examples
of maladaptive “happiness” include the excitement of risk
taking, being “high” on drugs, and short-lived satisfaction
from binge eating, tantrums, promiscuity, and revenge. It
is because of such ambiguity of meaning that throughout
this section the term “subjective well-being” is substituted
for “happiness.”
Only in the last decade have investigators such as Bar-
bara Fredrickson (63), Martin Seligman (36), and David
Snowdon (64) pointed out that a primary function of posi-
tive emotional states and optimism is facilitation of self-
care. Subjective well-being makes available personal re-
sources that can be directed toward innovation and cre-
ativity in thought and action. Thus, subjective well-being,
like optimism, becomes an antidote to learned helpless-
ness. Again, after control for income, education, weight,
smoking, drinking, and disease, happy people are perhaps
only half as likely to die at an early age or become disabled
as unhappy people (65).
Until recently the scientific parameters of subjective well-
being were as vague as those for objective mental health. A
1967 definition suggested that a happy person is “young,
healthy, well-educated, well paid, extroverted, optimistic,
worry free, religious and married with high self esteem, a
good job, morals, and modest aspirations” (italics added)
(66). In the last 30 years, however, empirical research has
shown such a vacuous generalization only partly correct.
The italicized adjectives are all untrue or true only with
qualifications (37).
The Nuns Study provides perhaps the most convincing
link between subjective happiness and health (64, 67).
When they were in their 20s, 180 nuns were asked to write
a 2–3-page autobiography. Of those who expressed the
most positive emotion, only 24% had died by age 80. In
contrast, by the same age 54% of those who expressed the
least positive emotion had died.
Only in the last three decades have investigators, espe-
cially Edward Diener (3, 68), made a serious effort to re-
search the definitional and causal parameters of subjec-
tive well-being and thereby address important questions.
One such question is, Is subjective well-being more a
function of environmental good fortune, or is it more a
function of an inborn, genetically based temperament?
Put differently, Does subjective well-being reflect trait or
state? If subjective well-being reflects a safe environment
and the absence of stress, it should fluctuate over time,
and individuals happy in one domain in their lives might
not be happy in another.
The answer is that subjective well-being has more effect
on the environment than the environment exerts on it. For
example, investigators have been startled that a signifi-
cant number of AIDS victims perceive that their illness has
enhanced the quality of their subjective lives. Similarly, af-
ter a few weeks of temporary elation, the subjective well-
being of lottery winners returns to baseline.
In other words, subjective well-being is due more to
“top-down” processes—temperamental factors governing
subjective well-being—than to “bottom-up factors”—for
example, the fulfillment of universal human needs. In-
deed, subjective well-being is highly heritable and rela-
tively independent of demographic variables. The subjec-
tive well-being of monozygous twins raised apart is more
similar than that of heterozygous twins raised together
(69). Among the partially heritable factors making signifi-
cant contributions to a high level of subjective well-being
are a low level of trait neuroticism, high level of trait extra-
version, absence of alcoholism, and absence of major de-
pression (3). For example, when heritable variables are
controlled, subjective well-being—unlike tested intelli-
gence—is not affected by environmental factors such as
income, parental social class, age, and education.
Consistently, relationships are more important to sub-
jective well-being than is money. In a representative study
of 800 college alumni, respondents who preferred high in-
come, occupational success, and prestige over having very
close friends and a close marriage were twice as likely to
describe themselves as “fairly” or “very” unhappy (70).

Over the last two decades the doubling of net disposable
income in the western world did not affect subjective well-
being (3). Mean life satisfaction in socioeconomically
challenged Brazil and China is higher than in socioeco-
nomically blessed Japan and Germany.
In some instances environment can be important to
subjective well-being. Young widows remain subjectively
depressed for years. Even though their poverty has been
endured for centuries, respondents in very poor nations,
such as India and Nigeria, report lower subjective well-be-
ing than those in more prosperous nations. Pain from the
loss of a child never stops.
Maintaining self-efficacy, agency, and autonomy make
additional environmental contributions to subjective
well-being. Subjective well-being is usually higher in de-
mocracies than in dictatorships. Assuming responsibility
for favorable or unfavorable outcomes (internalization) is
another major factor leading to subjective well-being.
Placing the blame elsewhere (externalization) signifi-
cantly reduces subjective well-being. In other words, para-
noia and projection make people feel worse rather than
better. Religiosity is consistently and positively correlated
with well-being, but there may be a chicken-egg relation-
ship between social support and religious observance. For
example, among church-goers it is difficult to disentangle
where spiritual faith ends and community support begins.
The research agenda for subjective well-being includes
establishing with greater definition the relative contribu-
tions of heredity and of environment and culture. In ad-
dition, we need to establish the magnitude of the contri-
bution of subjective well-being to the other models. We
need to disentangle interpersonal happiness (model D)
from intrapersonal happiness (model E).
Model F: Mental Health as Resilience
In 1865, Claude Bernard, the founder of experimental
medicine, declared, “We shall never have a science of
medicine as long as we separate the explanation of the
pathological from the explanation of normal, vital phe-
nomena” (71). Later, Meyer (72) perhaps overstated the
case when he asserted that there are no mental diseases,
there are only characteristic patterns of reaction to stress.
But Meyer drew attention to the fact that mentally healthy
responses to stress, analogous to pus and cough, are often
misinterpreted as pathological.
There are three broad classes of coping mechanisms
that humans use to overcome stressful situations. First,
there are the ways in which an individual elicits help from
appropriate others: namely, consciously seeking social
support. Second, there are conscious cognitive strategies
that we intentionally use to master stress (73). Third, there
are involuntary mental coping mechanisms (often called
“defense mechanisms” or “denial”) (74). This third, invol-
untary class of coping mechanisms reduces conflict and
cognitive dissonance during sudden changes in internal
and external reality. If such sudden changes are not “dis-
torted” and “denied,” they can result in disabling anxiety
and/or depression. Such homeostatic mental defenses
shield us from sudden changes in the four lodestars of
conflict. These four lodestars are affect/impulse, reality,
relationships, and social learning. Involuntary coping
mechanisms can abolish impulse (e.g., by reaction forma-
tion), relationships (e.g., by schizoid fantasy), reality (e.g.,
by psychotic denial), or social learning (e.g., by acting out).
They can alter our conscious recognition of the subject
(e.g., by projection) or the object (e.g., by turning against
the self) of a conflict, our awareness of the conflictual idea
(e.g., by repression), or the conflictual affect associated
with the idea (e.g., by isolation of affect).
By 1970, defense mechanisms, like many psychoana-
lytic metaphors, had been largely discarded by most em-
pirical social scientists. Consistency of definition and rater
reliability were lacking. But over the last 30 years, the idea
of healthy involuntary coping has entered the literature of
empirical cognitive psychology under such rubrics as
“hardiness” (75), “self-deception” and “emotional coping”
(73), and “illusion” (76). In the last decade experimental
strategies for assessing defense mechanisms have also im-
proved (77–80). Several reviews have also clarified our un-
derstanding of healthy and unhealthy defenses (81, 82). By
offering both a tentative hierarchy and a glossary of con-
sensually validated definitions, an optional axis of invol-
untary coping mechanisms was added to DSM-IV. The De-
fensive Function Scale (DSM-IV, p. 752) has set the stage
for further progress in our understanding of positive men-
tal health. In addition, in terms of predictive validity (i.e.,
predicting future mental health), the Defensive Function
Scale is as powerful a tool as we have (83–85). Neverthe-
less, no one has yet developed a method for assessing de-
fenses that meets conventional standards for psychomet-
ric reliability. The Q-sort technique is perhaps the most
promising (80).
All classes of defenses in the Defensive Function Scale
are effective in “denying” or defusing conflict and in “re-
pressing” or minimizing stress, but they differ greatly in
the psychiatric diagnoses assigned to their users and in
their consequences for long-term biopsychosocial adap-
tation. In level 1, the most pathological category, are found
denial and distortion of external reality. These mecha-
nisms are common in young children, in our dreams, and
in psychosis. To breach them requires altering the brain by
neuroleptics or waking the dreamer.
More common to everyday life are the relatively mal-
adaptive defenses found in levels 2–5. Defenses in these
categories are common in adolescents, in immature
adults, and in individuals with personality disorders. They
often make others more uncomfortable than the user.
Such defenses are consistently and negatively correlated
with global assessment of mental health, and they pro-
foundly distort the affective component of interpersonal
relationships. The third class of defenses, those in level 6,
1382
Am J Psychiatry 160:8, August 2003
MENTAL HEALTH
http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org
are often associated with what DSM-IV calls axis I anxiety
disorders and with the psychopathology of everyday life.
These include mechanisms such as repression, intellectu-
alization, and reaction formation. They are common to
everyone from 5 years old until death. They are neither
healthy nor unhealthy.
The mechanisms at level 7 still distort and alter feelings,
conscience, relationships, and reality, but they achieve
these alterations gracefully and flexibly. These mecha-
nisms allow the individual consciously to experience the
affective component of interpersonal relationships but in
a tempered fashion. Thus, the beholder may regard level 7
adaptive defenses as virtues, just as the same beholder
might regard the prejudice of projection and the tantrums
of acting out as sins. Doing as one would be done by (altru-
ism), keeping a stiff upper lip (suppression), keeping fu-
ture pain in awareness (anticipation), being able not to
take one’s self too seriously (humor), and turning lemons
into lemonade (sublimation) are the very stuff from which
positive mental health is made. In addition, the thoughtful
reader may wish to add involuntary but adaptive offences:
for example, creativity, charisma, leadership, courage, and
vision. Unfortunately, like tightrope walking, without
months of practice mature mechanisms cannot easily be
deployed voluntarily and only then by those with innate
balance.
Identification of defenses is difficult and has impeded
research. Rarely can we identify our own defenses, and we
often fail to recognize them in others or even project our
own. Like other facets of mental health, the reliable identi-
fication of healthy but unconscious defenses requires lon-
gitudinal study. Whether we ultimately view another’s
coping response as healthy or psychopathic depends on
the results of their involuntary efforts.
Besides establishment of rater reliability and obtaining
further evidence that the Defensive Function Scale de-
serves to be retained, twin and fMRI studies are needed to
test whether these metaphorical mechanisms are, as hy-
pothesized, biologically based homeostatic processes. The
research agenda must include examination of how best to
facilitate in the clinic the transformation of less adaptive
defenses into more adaptive defenses. One suggestion has
been, first, to increase social supports and interpersonal
safety and, second, to facilitate the intactness of the CNS
(e.g., through rest, nutrition, and sobriety) (53).
Future Directions
In conclusion, it seems important to review some of the
safeguards for a study of positive mental health. Mental
health must always be broadly defined in terms that are
culturally sensitive and inclusive. The criteria for mental
health must be empirically and longitudinally validated.
Third, validation means special attention to cross-cultural
studies (86). Fourth, in trying to improve mental health we
must respect individual autonomy. Finally, any student of
health must remember that there are differences between
real mental health and value-ridden morality, and be-
tween real success at living and mere questing after the
bitch goddess success.
Nevertheless, we need to be able to measure and
record mental health. The mental status and formulation
should both reflect not only the absence of symptoms
but also an assessment of social competence and coping
style. Although room exists for improvement, axis V, the
GAF Scale, provides the same reliability as and greater pre-
dictive validity than the presence or absence of most axis I
and II designations. No psychiatric chart should be with-
out it. The capacities to work and to love over time are ex-
tremely important indices of mental health. They are far
more important than the cross-sectional presence or ab-
sence of anxiety, depression, or illegal drug use. But such
capacities must be assessed longitudinally. “How many
years since age 21 have you spent employed?” is a more
useful question than “What is your present job?” Again,
“Tell me about your longest intimate relationship” is much
more useful than “Are you married?”
As with the blind men and the elephant, this article has
suggested six conceptually distinct ways to assess a single
construct—mental health. It would be a terrible mistake to
believe any one of these six models superior to all the oth-
ers. Rather, all are important and all are highly correlated
with each other (83). In conducting future research on
positive mental health, multivariate comparison will be
needed to reveal the relative contribution of each model.
Equally important, in the area of national health policy, if
and when interventions to improve positive mental health
are identified, who should pay: the consumer, the educa-
tional system, the medical care system, or some as-yet-to-
be-identified payer?

rom 1998 to 2003, the Solomon Islands, a generally 
peaceful low-income country in the South Pacific, 
experienced a prolonged crisis known locally as 
the ‘tensions’.1 The armed conflict and growing lawless-
ness that shook the ‘Happy Isles’ resulted in hundreds 
of people being killed and thousands more being made 
homeless before the Australian-led Regional Assistance 
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) arrived in July 
2003 to restore peace and stability. While fighting had 
been largely confined to Guadalcanal, where the capi-
tal (Honiara) is located, ramifications for the country’s 
economy and public services and for the people’s confi-
dence were widespread and lasted much longer.
This paper describes the impact of the conflict and 
­
subsequent political unrest and natural disasters on the 
people’s mental health and psychosocial wellbeing. The 
paper also describes developments in mental health 
­
services since 2003, highlighting some of the key 
achievements and continuing challenges.
Country context
The Solomon Islands is a diverse country with more 
than 900 islands scattered over a sea area of about 1.5 
million km2, and 70 language groups. In addition to 
Honiara, there are eight other provinces. At the 2009 
census the population was 515,870 and estimated to be 
growing at 2.3% per annum.2 About 80% of the popula-
tion live in rural areas and nearly 40% are under the age 
of 15.3
In 2014, the Human Development Index placed Solomon 
Islands at 157 out of 187 countries, indicating an overall 
low level of development based on health, education, 
and income.4 The economy, although stronger in recent

Abstract
Objective: To describe the impact on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of the armed conflict that occurred 
in the Solomon Islands from 1998–2003 and the subsequent political unrest and natural disasters, and the develop-
ments in mental health services since 2003.
Method: A literature and document review was conducted, supplemented by the written reflections of senior staff 
in the Solomon Islands Mental Health Service.
Results: Conflict and natural disaster have had a significant impact on the mental health and functioning of indi-
viduals, families and communities. National health system reform has been accompanied by the reorientation of the 
mental health services from custodial care to care in the community and greater emphasis on mental health promo-
tion and prevention. The dedication of the small group of Solomon Islands mental health professionals, supported 
by local health service managers and external donors, has been a major strength. However, they face significant 
challenges.
Conclusions: Continued investment in mental health, including the treatment and prevention of mental and 
substance use disorders, is essential for mental health and development outcomes. All development stakeholders, 
including civil society, government, academic and research institutions, and development partners, have a role to 
play.

years, remains heavily reliant on external donor sup-
port.3
In addition to the social and economic consequences of 
the conflict (which reflected both long-standing ethnic 
tensions and increasing disputes over land and resources) 
and post-election riots in 2006, the Solomon Islands has 
been hit by global fuel and financial crises and a succes-
sion of natural disasters (see timeline in Table 1). Like 
many other Pacific island nations, parts of the country 
are at risk due to rising tides and sea levels.5
Population mental health and 
wellbeing
According to the 2010 Global Burden of Diseases Study 
(GBD 2010), major depressive disorders are among the 
top five causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) in the 
Solomon Islands. They are ranked 15 in the leading 
causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Self-harm 
is ranked 17. Between 1990 and 2010, self-harm moved 
up in rank from 14 to 12 as a cause of premature mortal-
ity or years of life lost (YLLs), while interpersonal vio-
lence jumped from 27 to 18.6 Looking back over 20 
years, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of conflict, 
natural disasters and general societal changes, including 
urbanisation, on such figures.
In the aftermath of the ‘tensions’, people were homeless, 
traumatised and fearful. Lack of confidence to move 
around freely, including to other provinces, affected 
livelihoods and income, education, access to health ser-
vices, and participation in religious activities. Ten years 
later, people were still reluctant to travel in some areas of 
Guadalcanal and Malaita for fear of ‘pay back’. Such fear 
affects the delivery of routine government services and 
restricts any response to a disaster or disease epidemic. 
Plans for development often end in dispute and develop-
ment is suppressed. It is still sensitive to talk about the 
‘tensions’.
Long-term behaviour changes observed include disre-
gard for community norms and church and family val-
ues, and family violence and breakdown. Increased 
substance use and anti-social behaviour, particularly 
among youth, are a major concern for community lead-
ers.7,8 Alcohol and cannabis abuse adversely affect family 
and community relationships, which are often no longer 
harmonious. While binge drinking has been common, 
some people are now observed drinking on a daily basis, 
possibly to cope with life stressors.
Service utilisation data show increased presentations by 
people with cannabis psychosis; however, there is a lack 
of population data on trends in mental and substance 
use disorders over time. It is clear that that many people

still feel their losses deeply. Others continue to display 
unprovoked aggressive behaviour. The extent of PTSD 
among combatants and others is unknown.
Although there was little actual fighting, Western 
Province was affected by conflict in both the Solomon 
Islands and Bougainville.1 Box 1 outlines some of the 
social and behavioural changes observed in this prov-
ince since the ‘tensions’.
In April 2007, an earthquake measuring 8.1 on the 
Richter scale triggered a tsunami and sea surges which 
caused massive damage to areas of the Western and 
Choiseul provinces. Over the following months, the 
majority of people spoken to by mental health staff in 
their communities or temporary camps reported psycho-
logical and physical complaints. Flash floods that struck 
Honiara in April 2014 without warning resulted in wide-
spread loss and distress (Gaiofa D, personal communica-
tion, 2014).
Health system
The Ministry of Health and Medical Services is the cen-
tral actor in the Solomon Islands health system: it func-
tions as funder, regulator, and provider of nearly all 
services. Non-government organisations and faith-based 
organisations also make significant contributions in 
terms of additional funding and service delivery. The 
private sector plays a minimal role.2
The national health system is based on a public health 
care approach. Current priorities, as set out in the 
National Health Strategic Plan 2011–2015, reflect the 
growing significance of non-communicable diseases and 
the need to focus on whole-of-government approaches 
to health promotion and disease prevention.8
The Ministry is organised through five major divisions 
and sections: health improvement; public health; health 
care; health policy and planning; and administration 
and management. The National Mental Health Program 
is part of the Health Improvement Division, which 
includes a number of national public health programs, 
as well as links to the provincial health services. The 
National Psychiatric Unit, based at Kilu’ufi Hospital in 
Malaita, is part of the Health Care Division.8
Mental health services
The focus of the mental health services has moved from 
custodial care to care in the community and a greater 
emphasis on prevention, promotion and early interven-
tion reflecting national health system changes. These 
developments have been led by Solomon Islanders. 
Funding and technical support have been provided by 
development partners including the World Health 
Organization and AusAID (Australian bilateral develop-
ment agency now absorbed into the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)) through the Health 
Institutional Strengthening Program (part of Australia’s 
non-military support under RAMSI) and other schemes.
A National Mental Health Strategy with a five-year 
framework for action was adopted in 2005. A whole-of-
government national mental health policy was devel-
oped in 2009, but has not been formally endorsed by 
cabinet due to competing priorities. A community men-
tal health operational policy was prepared by the com-
munity mental health team in Honiara in 2010.
In 2011, funding for the National Mental Health Program 
was about SBD$4.7 million per year, equivalent to 0.8% 
of the health budget. This is planned to increase to about 
1.2% in 2015.8 The National Psychiatric Unit is funded 
separately.
Workforce development has been a major focus for the 
Ministry. Between 2004 and 2012, 11 Solomon Islanders 
Box 1.  Western Province perspective – after the ‘tensions’
In some communities after the tensions, community spirit was strengthened and sharing and working together improved, 
while in other communities it was the opposite. Nowadays people want to live in a group unlike before; most have left 
their small villages and settled in larger communities. Freedom of movement is still compromised, as well as employment 
and education. It is evident in some organisations that most employees are from one or two islands only and secondary 
schools are selective in their students. Previously most families kept their pigs on the islands but they were stolen during 
the tensions and today most keep them near the houses. Before the tensions soccer tournaments were held almost weekly, 
bringing people together. Afterwards this was not the case. Only this year communities are staring to organise sporting 
activities again, for both men and women. Illegal activities have been on the rise, with most of the tactics used by the youths 
involved taught by the people from war-torn Bougainville. Attitudes to compensation have also changed; nowadays people 
are asking compensation after compensation and for large amounts of money. I believe that this must be one of the influences 
of tensions. Finally, it seems to me that people today are not willing to work but prefer staying at home. In a family may be 
one or two will go up to the garden to get something for dinner then come back. The usual gardening way is being lost. If 
this continues, there will be poverty which will lead to increased unlawful activities, increased physical and mental health 
problems and increased government expenditures (Kiloe E, personal communication, 2014).

completed tertiary studies overseas in mental health 
nursing or community mental health and psychosocial 
rehabilitation. The first Solomon Islander psychiatrist 
took up his post in 20079, while the second (RM) will 
compete his training at the University of Papua New 
Guinea in 2015. This makes the Solomon Islands one of 
only three Pacific island nations to have their own citi-
zens trained as psychiatrists, the other two being Papua 
New Guinea and Fiji. Most mental health human 
resources are based in Honiara. Providing clinical ­
support 
and supervision, as well as professional development 
opportunities, for those who work in the provinces 
remains a challenge. Technology, including the internet, 
mobile phones and radio, has a role to play here.
Infrastructure is an ongoing problem. The 24-bed 
National Psychiatric Unit, badly neglected for many 
years, was closed for repair and renovations from 2012 
to May 2014. The newer four-bed acute facility at the 
National Referral Hospital in Honiara is often over-
crowded and needs upgrading to meet contemporary 
standards and community expectations. The Mental 
Treatment Act (1978) has warranted revision for some 
time. Monitoring of human rights within mental health 
facilities and ending discrimination against people with 
mental disorders in the workplace and society generally 
need much greater attention.
Other challenges include keeping mental health on the 
national policy agenda;10 addressing stigma; integrating 
mental health into general health services and building 
the primary mental health workforce; strengthening 
family and community support systems; and delivering 
services more equitably across the country. In many 
places, the community relies on traditional practices 
and prayer healing by church leaders; accessing help 
from the health service is not easy and usually the last 
resort.7,11 Lack of mental health data at the population 
level hampers informed decision-making. Service utilisa-
tion data collection and reporting have been patchy in 
recent years.
Conclusion
The commitment and dedication of the mental health 
staff in caring for patients, supporting their families and 
working to improve the mental health of the community, 
often in difficult circumstances, is a major strength of 
mental health services in the Solomon Islands. Assisted by 
their local health service managers and by psychiatrists 
and mental health professionals from other countries, 
they are making an important contribution towards a 
future where ‘The People of the Solomon Islands will be 
Healthy, Happy and Productive!’8: p.4 Continued invest-
ment in mental health, including the treatment and pre-
vention of mental and substance use disorders, is essential 
for mental health and development outcomes. All devel-
opment stakeholders, including civil society, government, 
academic and research institutions, and development 
partners, have a role to play.

Pathophysiology of ADHD
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among 
the most common neurobehavioral problems afflicting chil-
dren between 6 and 17 years of age; its prevalence in the 
United States is believed to range from 2% to 18% in this 
age group.1 ADHD is considered to be a heritable, chronic, 
neurobehavioral disorder that is characterized by hyperac-
tivity, inattention, and impulsivity.2 Three subtypes of 
ADHD are now recognized: predominantly hyperactive 
impulsive, predominantly inattentive, and a combined type, 
characterized by a combination of the first 2 subtypes.1,3
Children and adolescents suffering from ADHD experi-
ence challenging key formative years. Because of impulsive 
behavior and slower rates of processing information,4 they 
perform poorly on standardized tests, score lower grades, 
and are more likely to drop out of school.2 Impulsiveness 
also increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents and spon-
taneous sexual encounters, which may explain higher rates 
of teen pregnancies and incidence of sexually transmitted 
diseases in these individuals.2,5 Lower self-esteem leads to 
problems in social relationships, tendency for substance 
abuse, and problems with law enforcement agencies.2 In 
addition, ADHD often presents with one or more comor-
bidities such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), major 
depressive disorder (MDD), and anxiety disorders, thus 
bestowing additional challenges on these individuals.1

A Review of the Pathophysiology, Etiology, 
and Treatment of Attention-Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Alok Sharma, PhD1, and Justin Couture1
Abstract
Objective: To review the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Data Sources and Data Extraction: A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE using the terms 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder, ADHD, pathophysiology, etiology, and neurobiology. Limits applied were the following: 
published in the past 10 years (January 2003 to August 2013), humans, review, meta-analysis, and English language. These 
yielded 63 articles in PubMed and 74 in EMBASE. After removing duplicate/irrelevant articles, 86 articles and their relevant 
reference citations were reviewed. Data Synthesis: ADHD is a neurological disorder that affects children, but symptoms 
may persist into adulthood. Individuals suffering from this disorder exhibit hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, and 
problems in social interaction and academic performance. Medications used to treat ADHD such as methylphenidate, 
amphetamine, and atomoxetine indicate a dopamine/norepinephrine deficit as the neurochemical basis of ADHD, but the 
etiology is more complex. Moreover, these agents have poor adverse effect profiles and a multitude of drug interactions. 
Because these drugs are also dispensed to adults who may have concomitant conditions or medications, a pharmacist 
needs to be aware of these adverse events and drug interactions. This review, therefore, focuses on the pathophysiology, 
etiology, and treatment of ADHD and details the adverse effects and drug interaction profiles of the drugs used to treat 
it. Conclusions: Published research shows the benefit of drug therapy for ADHD in children, but given the poor adverse 
effect and drug interaction profiles, these must be dispensed with caution.

About 60% to 80% of the symptoms of ADHD persist into 
adulthood.2 Thus, ADHD is not just a childhood disorder 
that resolves spontaneously after adolescence. It is esti-
mated that about 4% to 4.5% of adults in the United States 
have ADHD.6,7 Manifestations in adults include inferior job 
performance, lower socioeconomic status, and marital/rela-
tionship problems.8 Thus, the lower quality of life in indi-
viduals afflicted with ADHD necessitates treatment to avoid 
multiple issues that these individuals face as children, ado-
lescents, and adults.
Etiology of ADHD
Although the exact etiology of ADHD is still unknown, ini-
tial hypotheses of reduced brain function were based on 
several observations of reduced volume or functionality of 
gray and white matter in the brain, leading to deficits in 
cognitive processing, attention, motor planning, speed of 
processing responses, and other behavioral issues observed 
in ADHD.4 More recently, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cau-
date, and cerebellum have emerged as the primary areas 
showing deficits in ADHD. These areas are interconnected 
by a network of neurons and together regulate attention, 
thoughts, emotions, behavior, and actions.9,10 Studies in 
ADHD patients have shown slower maturation of PFC11 or 
a smaller volume and reduced activity of the PFC, caudate, 
or cerebellum.9 The network activity between these areas is 
“extremely sensitive to the neurochemical environment,”9 
and is maintained by neurotransmitters (NTs), dopamine 
(DA), and norepinephrine (NE) acting in conjunction with 
each other via multiple receptors12-15 that may be either pre-
synaptic or postsynaptic (Figure 1).16,17
Several studies have reported that the DA receptor den-
sity in several brain regions of ADHD patients is lower than 
normal.4,18,19 Polymorphisms of the genes that encode DA 
D4 receptors (DRD4), DA D5 receptors (DRD5), and DA 
Figure 1.  Integration of the hypoactive and hyperactive catecholamine postulates of ADHD: DA (yellow circles) acts on 5 DA 
receptors (labeled as D1-D5) that may be present on postsynaptic neurons (shown in blue). The D2 and D3 receptors are also localized 
on the presynaptic neurons (shown in dark red). In the absence of an action potential, a small amount of vesicular DA is released 
into the synapse by the presynaptic terminal (A). This constitutes the tonic pool that acts on the D2/D3 presynaptic receptors, which 
provide a feedback inhibition to inhibit the release of DA (B). Following the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal 
(C), a large amount of vesicular DA is released into the synapse; this constitutes the phasic pool (D) that acts on the postsynaptic 
receptors. The amount of DA released in the phasic pool is dependent on the feedback inhibition provided by the  
D2/D3 receptor stimulation by the tonic pool. The action of DA on the postsynaptic receptors is terminated following its reuptake 
into the presynaptic terminal by the DA transporter-1 (DAT-1) (E). Similarly, NE receptors are classified as α and β receptors, which 
are further classified as α1 (α1A, α1B, α1D) and α2 (α2A, α2B, α2C) and β1, β2, and β3 receptors. Like the D2/D3 receptors, the presynaptic 
α2 receptors act as autoreceptors but are believed to be present to a greater extent at postsynaptic sites in the brain, with α2A being 
the most predominant type in the PFC. Like DAT-1, the NE transporter (NET) reuptakes the released NE back into the presynaptic 
terminal for storage and future release, and thus, the level of postsynaptic receptors for NE is dependent on both the activity of the 
presynaptic α2A receptors and NET. It is hypothesized that when an individual is bored/fatigued, too little DA/NE is released, thereby 
resulting in an insufficient activation of postsynaptic D1 and α2A receptors; this leads to the individual being easily distracted and 
impulsive. Under stressful conditions, too much of these NTs are released, leading to overstimulation of these receptors, which leads 
to misguided attention and responses. A modest stimulation of the postsynaptic receptors of DA/NE favors guided attention, focus, 
and organization of thoughts and actions. In ADHD, the tonic pool is hypothesized to be reduced, which allows for a larger-than-
normal phasic release of DA and, hence, disorganized behavior leading to inattention, hyperactivity, and so on. By blocking the DAT-1/
NET, stimulants enhance the tonic pool and thus attenuate the larger-than-normal phasic release caused by the action potential, which 
may be the underlying problem in ADHD.

transporter (DAT-1) have also been reported to cause 
reduced functionality of the dopaminergic system.20 
Whereas a decreased receptor density or genetic polymor-
phisms related to the NE system in ADHD has not been 
determined,20 disruption of α2A receptor function leads to 
impaired attention and impulse control and hyperactivity.9 
Taken together, these studies pointed to a reduced DA and/
or NE function hypothesis in ADHD, which was in perfect 
agreement with the mechanism of action of the medications 
used to treat ADHD. For example, methylphenidate, 
amphetamine, and atomoxetine enhance DA and NE trans-
mission in PFC, whereas guanfacine stimulates postsynap-
tic α2A receptors directly.9
However, several studies pointed toward a hyperactive 
DA and/or NE system in ADHD.14 More recently, an A559V 
mutation and a R615C mutation in DAT-1 has been identi-
fied in some ADHD patients, which either increase the 
efflux of DA or decrease the presynaptic uptake of DA, 
indicating a hyperactive DA response in these individu-
als.16,21,22 Moreover, methylphenidate and amphetamine 
ameliorate ADHD symptoms in the A559V mutation cohort 
by blocking the increased efflux of DA.21 It is also argued 
that if a simple deficit in NT level exists in ADHD, direct 
stimulation of the postsynaptic receptors should ameliorate 
ADHD symptoms. However, administering DA agonists 
such as piribedil, amantadine,14 or levodopa/carbidopa 
combination23,24 does not improve attention in ADHD 
patients. Taken together, the studies pointing toward under-
active or hyperactive DA/NE systems imply a more com-
plex etiology of ADHD.
The hypoactive and hyperactive catecholamine hypoth-
eses of ADHD have been integrated by the facts that DA 
and NE may exhibit an inverted U-shaped dose-response 
curve9 similar to that observed with vitamins, where either 
extreme is a problem and that 2 separate pools of DA14 and 
NE25 exist in the brain (Figure 1). An appropriate level of 
DA/NE is required for optimal functioning of the PFC, and 
disruption leads to ADHD. Medications helpful in ADHD 
restore the delicate balance of the NTs in the PFC and are 
discussed later. However, a correct diagnosis of ADHD 
must precede prescription of these drugs to avoid exposing 
unaffected individuals to these drugs unnecessarily.
Diagnosis of ADHD
Although several imaging studies have investigated the 
possibility of finding a diagnostic marker for ADHD,26-31 
this potential has not yet been realized, possibly because of 
the complexity of the disorder itself. Clinicians in the 
United States should therefore follow the guidelines set 
forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) for diagnosing ADHD.3 
However, given that there are 3 subtypes of ADHD, each 
with differing symptomatology, the requirement that at least 
6 symptoms must be displayed by children (5 for individu-
als older than 17 years) for at least 6 months to be diagnosed 
as suffering from a particular subtype of ADHD and that 
some degree of functional impairment must be obvious in 
multiple settings,1,3,32 correct diagnosis of ADHD based on 
these subjective criteria is difficult. Comorbidities such as 
ODD, MDD, and anxiety disorders create more difficulties 
for ADHD diagnosis because of the similarities of these dis-
orders with symptoms and characteristics of ADHD.
Although the criteria listed in DSM-V for ADHD are an 
improvement over DSM-IV-TR, they still fail to address the 
issue of sex differences in ADHD.1,33 For example, whereas 
males are 3 times more likely to have ADHD than females 
and exhibit the predominantly hyperactive or combined 
type,2 females are more likely to exhibit the predominantly 
inattentive subtype and tend to suffer from mental impair-
ment and eating disorders.34 Males tend to have more prob-
lems with aggression and are more likely to abuse the law.34 
Clinicians must be aware of these sexual and developmen-
tal differences between individuals to ensure that ADHD is 
not over- or underdiagnosed. Thus, diagnosing ADHD is a 
complex and challenging process and must be done by 
trained professionals carefully after repeated observations 
and reports obtained from parents, teachers, or other care-
givers and ensuring that there are no other underlying disor-
ders that may potentially be mislabeled as ADHD.5,35
Several rating scales based on DSM-IV-TR were devised 
to confer objectivity and quantification to the subjective cri-
teria listed in DSM-IV-TR. These rating scales are broadly 
classified as narrow band and broad band, depending on 
whether they test for the presence of a specific or a broad 
range of behavior/manifestations, respectively.36 Whereas 
broad-band scales do provide a better overall clinical pic-
ture, the narrow band scales are used more often (especially 
for monitoring therapeutic efficacy) for their robustness and 
minimum time involved.36 These narrow-band scales may 
be based on self-report (by adolescents) or those completed 
by parents, teachers, or caregivers assessing internalizing 
behaviors (eg, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders) 
and externalizing behaviors (eg, hyperactivity, impulsivity, 
and inattention), respectively. The adult-reported scales, 
therefore, offer a better measure of monitoring efficacy of a 
treatment. The more commonly used narrow-band scales in 
clinical practice include37 the Conners Rating Scales–
Revised; Inattention/Overactivity With Aggression (IOWA) 
Conners Teacher Rating Scale; Swanson, Nolan, and 
Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV) Questionnaire; Swanson, Kotkin, 
Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) rating scale; ADHD 
Rating Scale-IV; Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale; and 
ADHD Symptom Rating Scale, each possessing its own 
strengths and limitations.36
It is imperative for clinicians to recognize that although 
these scales are based on DSM-IV-TR criteria for diagnos-
ing ADHD, their limitations36 and their questionable 
212	
Annals of Pharmacotherapy 48(2)
specificity and sensitivity should preclude their use as sole 
diagnostic criteria for ADHD.37 Lack of specificity in spite 
of high sensitivity of the Conners Teacher and Parent Rating 
Scales for determining ADHD was recently described,38 
leading to many false-positive diagnoses of ADHD. Thus, 
the results of these scales should be limited to document the 
subjective criteria listed in the DSM-IV-TR (and thus serve 
as a component of the diagnosis)37 and for monitoring the 
efficacy of the treatment.
Treatment of ADHD
Treatment of ADHD may consist of drug therapy, behav-
ioral therapy, or their combination. Regardless of the 
approach used, treatment is recommended for all children 
because early and effective treatment of ADHD has been 
reported to yield a better prognosis and fewer problems in 
adulthood2 and provide a reprieve to parents and 
teachers.39
Initially, many psychologists believed that ADHD may 
be a result of poor parenting; this led to several behavioral 
approaches to treat ADHD.40,41 However, these approaches 
were not universally effective in all patients. Following evi-
dence for a neurochemical basis for ADHD, drug therapy 
was purported to be more effective than behavioral therapy. 
Many physicians combined drug therapy and behavioral 
therapy; however, the relative efficacy of behavioral treat-
ment versus drug therapy, the benefit of adding them 
together, and the long-term benefit of either of the 
approaches used was unknown. These issues were addressed 
simultaneously in a landmark study called the Multimodal 
Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA). The 
results of the study42 and the follow-up results have been 
published43-45 and extensively reviewed.32,46-48 Although all 
approaches tested in the study were determined to provide a 
long-term benefit, drug therapy was superior to behavioral 
therapy in managing ADHD symptoms/manifestations and 
a combination of the 2 did not have an additive effect. 
Behavioral therapy was useful, but the effect was not as 
robust as for drug therapy. However, in other studies, behav-
ioral therapy has been shown to be equally efficacious as 
stimulants administered at low doses.49 Therefore, it may be 
useful for ADHD patients with mild symptoms and minimal 
impairment or when parents prefer it over drug therapy.37 It 
may also be used in conjunction with drug therapy if a par-
tial response is obtained to the drugs approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) or when comorbid disor-
ders are present concomitantly.37
Drugs approved by the FDA for treating ADHD include 
stimulants (considered first-line agents), such as methyl-
phenidate and amphetamines, and nonstimulants (consid-
ered alternative agents), such as atomoxetine and 
extended-release α-2 agonists (guanfacine and clonidine). 
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), immediate-release α-2 
agonists, and bupropion have been used off-label to treat 
ADHD; however, these are used only if the above agents 
fail to show benefit or cannot be used. These drugs are dis-
cussed in more detail below. Common adverse events and 
drug interactions are summarized in Table 1, and the recom-
mended dose for pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients is 
described in Table 2.
Stimulants
Two stimulant-based therapies are approved in the United 
States by the FDA for all age groups and include the amphet-
amines and methylphenidate. The FDA recommended dose 
for these drugs are listed in Table 2, but the effective dose 
needed for most adults surpass the FDA-approved maxi-
mum dose per day and is thus considered as off-label. 
However, the data on the efficacy and safety of these higher 
doses is limited.50
The stimulants interact with and inhibit DAT-1 and nor-
epinephrine transporter (NET), thereby inhibiting the reup-
take of DA and NE. However, amphetamine also gains 
access into the presynaptic terminal via DAT-1 and NET to 
release the stored NTs.51-53 Both stimulants inhibit mono-
amine oxidase, the enzyme that metabolizes these catechol-
amines; however, amphetamine is the more potent of the 
two.14 Thus, the net effect with either stimulant is to rectify 
the level of NTs such as DA and NE in the synapse. The 
slightly different mechanism of action between methylphe-
nidate and amphetamine explains why some patients failing 
to respond to one stimulant show a better response with the 
other.
Methylphenidate and amphetamines are considered as 
equally efficacious for long-term treatment of ADHD.54 
Both immediate and extended-release forms are available 
and have shown equal efficacy in clinical trials.55,56 
Although extended-release formulations are more expen-
sive than the immediate-delivery forms, they offer advan-
tages of convenience, confidentiality at school/work, and 
greater compliance.54 In adolescents, the long-acting forms 
may also improve driving performance46 and are less likely 
to be abused or diverted.57,58 However, only immediate-
release forms that are available in small enough doses can 
be used in small children because of the risk of overdose 
with long-acting forms.37
The use of stimulants, often lifelong, has raised several 
concerns and controversies over the years because amphet-
amines and methylphenidate are ranked as 6th and 12th for 
substances known to cause physical harm (alcohol and 
tobacco are 11th and 14th) and 8th and 13th for substances 
known to cause dependence (cannabis and LSD are 11th 
and 14th).59 However, stimulants do not seem to inhibit the 
NET and DAT-1 in nucleus accumbens (the area in the brain 
responsible for reward) when taken as prescribed.60 In fact, 
studies have shown that treating ADHD with stimulants

may decrease the risk of substance abuse,61,62 with a more 
robust effect apparent when initiated at an earlier age.63 
Imaging studies indicate a similar neurobiology between 
individuals suffering from ADHD and substance abusers64; 
thus, treating ADHD reduces substance abuse disorders 
concomitantly. Stimulant treatment has also been shown to 
decrease the likelihood for emergence of MDD, ODD, and 
anxiety disorders65 and reduce aggression and antisocial 
behavior66 in individuals with ADHD. Nevertheless, 
patients or their caregivers must be educated about the 
importance of using these as prescribed to ensure that drug 
diversion/abuse does not occur because at least 25% of 
adults and adolescents admitted to these behaviors in a 
survey.67
Because stimulants improved memory function in a con-
trol population,68 concerns were raised that they may pro-
vide an unfair advantage to ADHD individuals by improving 
academic or occupational performance beyond normal. 
However, it has been reported that although stimulants do 
increase academic productivity as a result of increased 
attention and concentration, they do not seem to enhance 
learning or improve academic performance in children or 
occupational performance in adults diagnosed with 
ADHD.69,70 Conversely, reports suggesting that high levels 
of DA and NE impair cognition9 led to concerns about 
memory impairment by stimulants; but whereas high doses 
of stimulants are reported to impair PFC performance in 
animals,71 they do not impair memory in the ADHD popula-
tion if used as prescribed.8 These data suggest that stimu-
lants have the capacity to normalize attention in ADHD 
patients without adverse or enhanced effects on memory if 
used as prescribed and reiterate the importance of educating 
the patients/caregivers of using these drugs as prescribed.
Whether stimulants affect physical growth is also con-
troversial because evidence refuting as well as supporting 
this premise exists. For example, some studies have reported 
that no clinically significant difference was observed on 
stimulant use.37,72,73 However, other studies indicate that 
stimulant use is associated with initial reduced physical 
growth,74,75 which is subsequently overcome.76 In 2 stud-
ies,77,78 it was determined that ADHD patients were taller 
and heavier to start with, and hence, it was hypothesized 
that slowed growth may not be obvious during treatment 
with stimulants.78 However, others have hypothesized that 
ADHD itself may be associated with a slower growth rate 
that resolves in adulthood.79 Thus, it is unclear at this time 
whether the reduced growth that has been observed in some 
studies actually exists and, if so, is a result of the ADHD 
itself or of the pharmacological/side effects of the medica-
tions (eg, anorexia). Regardless, it is recommended to eval-
uate children on stimulants every 6 months for height and 
weight.37 A drug holiday (weekends, summer, and other 
holidays) is recommended in individuals on stimulants 
showing reduced physical growth because brief cessation of 
therapy seems to eliminate these effects.80 The negative 
effects on growth had raised the concern that these medica-
tions may limit or hinder the growth of already compro-
mised brain regions that is observed in ADHD, but 
stimulants have been shown to increase the gray matter vol-
ume in the PFC and other areas of the brain in ADHD 
patients.11,81,82
Controversy also arose over the association of sudden 
death with the use of stimulants, leading to black box warn-
ings by the FDA. However, it was later determined that 
underlying cardiovascular problems may have been respon-
sible. Hence, any cardiac structural abnormalities, cardio-
myopathy, or abnormalities of the heart rhythm should 
preclude the use of stimulants.83 It is reasonable to monitor 
the electrocardiogram (ECG) of children exhibiting chest 
pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness or those who have a 
family history of cardiovascular problems.46
Several side effects (Table 1) are also of concern with 
stimulants.56,84-86 However, these are more prominent dur-
ing initiation of therapy and do not seem to hinder adher-
ence.87 Gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-related side effects may 
be limited by taking medication with or after meals and 
encouraging patients to eat larger and more nutritious 
breakfasts and dinners,87 when the plasma concentration of 
stimulants would be minimal. At this time, serving favorite 
food might also help.46 For insomnia, reducing the dose of 
stimulants or administering them earlier during the day may 
help. α-2 Agonists, cyproheptadine, or melatonin may also 
help with insomnia. Anxiety and tics can be reduced by 
adding atomoxetine, or antidepressants and α-2 agonists, 
respectively.87
Methylphenidate.  Methylphenidate can exist in 2 racemic 
pairs of 4 separate isomers (d, l-erythro pair and d, l-threo 
pair) because it contains 2 chiral centers. Although both 
enantiomers of the threo pair possess stimulant activity, the 
l-enantiomer is considered nonsignificant because it under-
goes extensive first-pass metabolism.88 Methylphenidate is 
generally preferred over amphetamine despite some reports 
that amphetamine possesses slightly better efficacy.89 For 
example, because of its slower uptake and clearance,90 it is 
much less likely to produce dependence and physical harm 
to the patient as compared with amphetamine.59 Addition-
ally, DA concentrations in the brain are increased by meth-
ylphenidate only when DA is being released actively in the 
brain, such as during complex cognitive tasks.91 Finally, 
because methylphenidate is metabolized by hepatic and 
peripheral esterases,92 drug interactions with other drugs 
that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
are less likely.
The specific formulations of methylphenidate may con-
tain a racemic mixture of the 2 isomers (Ritalin, Concerta, 
Metadate, and Daytrana) or may contain just the more 
active d-isomer (Focalin).93-97 Daytrana is a transdermal 
218

patch and, hence, may be preferred by patients who may 
find swallowing solid dosage forms difficult; additionally, it 
provides greater bioavailability than orally administered 
dosage forms because of the lack of a first-pass effect.37 
Oral dosage forms are available in immediate- as well as 
extended-release versions in multiple strengths with small 
increments of the dose of the drug. Manipulating the dose is 
thus easy for producing the desired effect with minimal side 
effects. Because individual differences exist between 
patients in their responsiveness to medications, the dose is 
titrated upward slowly every 1 to 3 weeks37,87,98 from the 
recommended starting dose, often based on body weight.99 
If extended-release forms are to be used ultimately, titration 
should be conducted with them directly.37
Proprietary extended-release versions are formulated to 
release different amounts of drug over a 24-hour period. 
Thus, whereas Ritalin LA releases 50% of the dose in each 
of the 2 bursts, these values are 22% and 78% for Concerta 
and 30% and 70% for Metadate CD. The latter were 
designed following reports that a system delivering a higher 
concentration in the afternoon provided a superior treat-
ment response than the one providing a steady-state con-
centration100-102; this may also explain why switching 
proprietary medications sometimes elucidates a better treat-
ment response.
Regardless of the proprietary medication used, methyl-
phenidate has similar pharmacological and side effects 
(Table 1), but the dosing recommendations may differ

Notes
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP), 2011
Preschool-aged children (4-5 years): 
parent- or teacher-administered behavior 
therapy; if not available or is not beneficial, 
methylphenidate may be used but only in 
moderate to severe dysfunction
Methylphenidate use in this population is 
off-label. Although dextroamphetamine 
is approved for use in this population, its 
use is not recommended because of lack 
of safety and efficacy data. Metabolism of 
stimulants in this population is slower; 
hence, a smaller initial dose and slower 
upward titration is recommended
Elementary school-aged children (6-11 
years): parent- or teacher-administered 
behavior therapy alone or in combination 
(preferable) with an FDA-approved 
medication
The evidence for use of FDA-approved 
medications is strongest for stimulants, 
followed by atomoxetine, extended-
release guanfacine, and finally, extended-
release clonidine; hence, most clinicians 
may use this sequential approach
Adolescents (12-18 years): FDA-approved 
medication alone or in combination with 
behavior therapy (preferred)
If substance abuse or medication diversion is 
an issue in this age group, stimulants with 
less abuse potential (Vyvanse, Daytrana, 
or Concerta) or nonstimulants should be 
used
American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), 
2007
For children (6-11 years) and adolescents 
(12-18 years): FDA-approved medication 
(stimulants or atomoxetine); if not 
beneficial, seek expert opinion for ADHD 
diagnosis; if diagnosis is confirmed, 
behavioral therapy alone or in combination 
with medications not approved by FDA 
should be used
Extended-release guanfacine and clonidine 
were approved by the FDA after these 
recommendations were published; hence, 
the recommendation for using an FDA-
approved medication includes stimulants 
or atomoxetine only

(Table 2). All formulations carry a high risk for abuse and 
dependence if not used as prescribed. Various drug-drug 
interactions are also possible (Table 1)93-97; thus, dose 
adjustments may be needed for many drugs that may be pre-
scribed concomitantly with stimulants. Daytrana can cause 
irritation at the application site, vomiting, tics, and emo-
tional instability.97 The patient should be advised to place 
the patch on a clean, dry, hairless area of the hip for a maxi-
mum of 9 hours, at least 2 hours before the benefits of this 
medication are needed. The patient should also be advised 
to rotate the site of application daily, not to share the patch, 
and dispose it carefully to avoid being ingested by pets or 
toddlers.103
Amphetamine Salts.  The most commonly used amphetamine 
formulations include Adderall XR and Vyvanse containing 
amphetamine salts, and prodrug lisdexamfetamine, respec-
tively. Both d- and l-optical isomers of amphetamine are 
active. Common side effects are similar to that of methyl-
phenidate (Table 1).104,105 Amphetamines are metabolized 
by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4104; hence, a 
multitude of drug interactions are possible (Table 2).104,105 
Additionally, CYP2D6 isoforms generate slow and fast 
metabolizers in the general population; thus, higher amphet-
amine concentrations may be observed in Latinos and Afri-
can Americans and about 7% of Caucasians.46 A slow 
upward titration of the dose as recommended for methyl-
phenidate may, in part, avoid the precipitation of severe side 
effects and/or toxicity in these slow metabolizers. Both for-
mulations containing amphetamines carry a potential risk 
for abuse and dependence as well as neurotoxicity if not 
used as prescribed.106 However, the release and absorption 
of amphetamine is slower with lisdexamfetamine, thereby 
limiting the euphoria and, hence, its abuse potential.57,58
Nonstimulants
Although stimulants are considered first-line agents, they 
may not be suitable for nearly 30% of ADHD patients.107,108 
Nonresponsiveness or partial responsiveness to stimulants; 
intolerance to their side effects (eg, insomnia); presence of 
medical issues such as psychiatric, cardiovascular, or tic 
disorders; and family aversion to controlled substances may 
require alternative agents categorized as nonstimulants for 
either replacing stimulants or added as adjuncts to treat 
ADHD. The FDA approved nonstimulants for treating 
ADHD are atomoxetine (Strattera) and extended-release 
α-2 agonists clonidine (Kapvay) and guanafacine (Intuniv).
Nonstimulants are believed to possess a less-robust effect 
than stimulants.37,46 However, well-controlled, head-to-head 
comparison trials do not exist, and the superior efficacy of 
stimulants (methylphenidate) over nonstimulants (atomox-
etine) is based on several meta-analyses.37,46,89,109,110 Some 
studies87and meta-analyses111 have determined noninferiority 
or equal efficacy of these 2 drugs, but the study methodolo-
gies and different outcome measures used in meta-analyses 
may partly explain this discrepancy. It is argued, however, 
that because most studies are conducted short term, they 
favor the stimulants because nonstimulants generally take 
several weeks to show their full effect.84,112,113 These issues 
underscore the need for long-term, randomized, double blind, 
placebo-controlled, head-to-head comparison trials between 
the 2 groups of drugs.
Atomoxetine (Strattera).  Atomoxetine (Strattera) is approved 
by the FDA for treating ADHD in children, adolescents, and 
adults. Like stimulants, atomoxetine increases the availabil-
ity of both NE and DA in the synapses of PFC114 to improve 
the PFC function in ADHD patients.115,116 However, because 
it lacks effects in the striatum and requires at least 4 to 6 
weeks to show full effect, it is less likely to be abused than 
stimulants.112,113,117 Hence, it may be preferred in patients 
where substance abuse is a problem/concern,37,46 but the 
time lag observed with atomoxetine underscores the need to 
counsel patients/caregivers to exhibit patience with this 
drug. It may also reduce tics and anxiety37,54 and may thus 
be useful in patients with these comorbidities.
Like stimulants, atomoxetine also produces the charac-
teristic inverted U-shaped dose-response curve,71 but the 
optimal dose varies between individuals.118 Clinical trials 
have investigated 0.5-, 1.2-, and 1.8-mg/kg doses and deter-
mined that the highest doses correlated with better ADHD 
symptom control, ODD, mood symptoms, and family func-
tioning.108 The FDA-approved maximum recommended 
dose, however, is the lesser of 1.4 mg/kg or 100 mg daily. A 
slow upward titration from 0.5 mg/kg every 3 to 4 days to 
about 1.2 mg/kg is recommended and must be administered 
at bedtime for the first 7 to 10 days to overcome sedation.87
Atomoxetine can be administered once daily in the 
morning or twice daily in divided doses. Although the once-
daily administration improves compliance with therapy, it is 
associated with more gastrointestinal tract side effects.119 
Atomoxetine is generally well tolerated because side effects 
are reported to be less problematic than for stimulants 
(Table 1). However, warnings regarding rare hepatotoxicity 
and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents were 
issued by the FDA in 2005. Liver function tests are not 
monitored routinely,108 but if hepatic impairment is obvi-
ous, initial and target doses should be reduced.120 Several 
drug interactions are also of concern and must be taken into 
account before prescribing/dispensing atomoxetine (Table 
1). Like amphetamine, atomoxetine is metabolized by 
CYP2D6120; hence, a slow upward titration of atomoxetine 
as outlined above limits the concern for increased toxicity 
in slow metabolizers. Atomoxetine, like stimulants, should 
not be administered in patients with uncontrolled hyperten-
sion, structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and 
abnormalities of the heart rhythm.120

α-2 Agonists.  Immediate release α-2 agonists such as guan-
facine (Intuniv) and clonidine (Kapvay) are FDA-approved 
agents to treat hypertension but were used off-label to treat 
ADHD.121-123 Extended-release forms of these drugs were 
recently approved by the FDA to treat ADHD in children 
and adolescents. Like atomoxetine, these drugs (in addition 
to TCAs and bupropion) may possess inferior efficacy as 
compared with stimulants but may be as efficacious as 
behavioral therapy.37,123 Thus, behavioral therapy is recom-
mended before using these agents.37
Guanfacine and clonidine act on the presynaptic and 
postsynaptic α2 receptors present in the neuronal cells. 
Because the amelioration of ADHD symptoms is believed 
to rely on stimulating postsynaptic α2A receptors and guan-
facine is more selective than clonidine at these receptors,124 
it may show better efficacy than clonidine. The selectivity 
of guanfacine toward postsynaptic α2A receptors46 in addi-
tion to a longer half-life119 imparts advantages of lesser 
sedation and dizziness than that observed with clonidine.
Guanfacine and clonidine may be administered alone or 
in combination with stimulants to counteract comorbid 
aggression, tics, or insomnia.37,87 Like atomoxetine, thera-
peutic benefit with these drugs is delayed and observed at 
about 4 weeks. Side effects are generally mild (Table 1) but 
may affect compliance. Hence, a gradual upward titration is 
recommended to determine the effective dose with minimal 
side effects. These drugs should not be withdrawn suddenly 
because of risk of hypertensive crisis, and hence, patients or 
their parents should be educated about the need for perfect 
adherence. A 1-to 2-week withdrawal is recommended for 
these drugs if they need to be discontinued,37 and cardiac 
consultation should be performed in individuals with car-
diovascular problems.87 For both these drugs, dose reduc-
tions and monitoring are recommended if used in patients 
with compromised liver and/or kidney function.121,122
Bupropion.  Bupropion is an FDA-approved antidepressant 
and a smoking cessation agent but has also been used off-
label to treat ADHD based on several studies.46,87,107 Like 
stimulants and atomoxetine, bupropion inhibits the reup-
take of both DA and NE but does not carry the potential risk 
of abuse and dependence seen with stimulants. It generally 
shows faster onset of action than atomoxetine or α-2 ago-
nists (~2 weeks) and seems to be as efficacious as these 
drugs. However, bupropion use has been associated with 
seizures and, hence, should not be used in patients with sei-
zure or eating disorders.46 Side effects are generally mild 
(Table 1) and can be minimized with administering bupro-
pion in divided doses.125
Although both immediate- and extended-release forms 
of bupropion are available, twice-daily administration of 
the extended-release form is recommended for children and 
adolescents because of the shorter half-life in these indi-
viduals.126 Bupropion is usually initiated at a dose of 3 mg/
kg (100-150 mg for most individuals) and is titrated to 6 
mg/kg (300 mg) in divided doses.87 Any single dose of 
bupropion should not exceed 150 mg,87 and the dose should 
be lowered in case of hepatic of renal impairment.127
Tricyclic Antidepressants.  The TCAs have been the most 
widely used off-label medications to treat ADHD for mono-
therapy; the long duration of action (because of the long 
half-life), no risk of abuse potential, and ability to overcome 
depression and tics were touted as distinct advantages over 
stimulants.39 However, they are generally not preferred 
nowadays because of a large number of cardiovascular, 
neurological, and anticholinergic side effects and drug 
interactions (Table 1) and because they have lesser efficacy 
than stimulants. These are, therefore, used only if individu-
als are nonresponsive to stimulants or alternative agents, 
cannot tolerate them, or have abuse potential, tics, or 
depression.
Imipramine, desipramine, and nortriptyline are the 
agents that have been used, but desipramine is least prefer-
able because of reports of sudden death.37 Additionally, the 
desipramine dose must be reduced in hepatic impairment. 
An ECG must be performed prior to initiating TCAs and 
after every dose increase to ensure cardiac safety.37 Like 
every other drug discussed above, these drugs should also 
be titrated upward slowly to improve tolerability and like 
α-2 agonists, a slow withdrawal should be performed if 
these drugs are to be discontinued.108 The slow upward 
titration may also limit the toxicity in slow metabolizers 
because TCAs are metabolized by CYP2D6.108
Therefore, although nonstimulants do not have abuse 
potential like stimulants do and are generally better toler-
ated than stimulants, they may possess inferior efficacy and 
a longer onset of action. Additional concerns with atomox-
etine (hepatotoxicity and suicidal ideation) and TCAs (side 
effects and drug interactions) and the inability to use these 
drugs in patients with cardiovascular problems necessitates 
finding better drugs to treat ADHD. Recently, a selective D4 
agonist, A-412997, has been shown to improve ADHD 
symptoms in rats without the abuse and/or dependence 
potential.128,129 Another drug that was well tolerated and 
seemed to show promise in clinical trials is a nicotinic 
receptor agonist ABT-418,130 but it does not seem to be 
under development currently.
Treatment Guidelines
Given the extensive literature available with respect to the 
pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of ADHD, it is 
surprising that the treatment guidelines are not well estab-
lished. Physicians, therefore, may have to rely on their clin-
ical experience, the patient or their family’s preference, 
presence of comorbid disorders, and any other medical con-
ditions that may preclude the use of the agents of choice.

The evidence-based clinical practice guidelines formu-
lated and published by the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP)131 provides a brief overview for approaching treat-
ment of ADHD (Table 3). Although these guidelines are 
useful in describing which approaches should be used, they 
do not describe an algorithmic approach to treatment if the 
stimulant/behavioral therapy fails to produce a desired 
response. A medication algorithm such as that designed in 
conjunction with the Texas Department of State Health 
Services125 (Table 3) was instrumental in guiding pharma-
cotherapy but was deemed controversial. The American 
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), 
therefore, formulated a practice parameter for the assess-
ment and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents 
(Table 3).37 Because extended-release guanfacine and cloni-
dine were approved by the FDA for treating ADHD after the 
Texas Medication algorithm and the AACAP guidelines 
were published, it remains to be determined whether this 
will affect the subsequent algorithm or guidelines that may 
be developed. It is entirely possible that following FDA 
approval, these drugs may be prescribed more often and, 
therefore, may provide a more solid base of evidence for 
their use.
The AACAP guidelines also call for periodic assessment 
to determine continued efficacy, safety, and need for phar-
macotherapy.37 Efficacy of the drug can be rapidly assessed 
by the rating scales that have already been discussed. Safety 
and need for therapy is assessed by monitoring physical 
well-being (height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, etc) and 
the emergence of side effects or comorbid disorders several 
times a year.37 Monitoring for efficacy and safety is gener-
ally not an issue during the slow upward titration phase but 
may become one once a patient achieves a stable dose that 
shows maximum efficacy with minimum side effects. A 
continuous monitoring not only ensures continuous efficacy 
and physical/mental well-being but may also provide evi-
dence for cessation of therapy. This may be considered if 
the patient has been stable on a particular dose for a long 
time and/or a missed dose did not cause deterioration.37 
However, drug withdrawal must be done during low-stress 
times, such as summer vacations, and cognitively challeng-
ing tasks must be provided at this time to ensure that remis-
sion has indeed occurred.37
Conclusions
ADHD is a complex disorder associated with multiple issues 
leading to a lower quality of life. A chemical imbalance of 
NTs such as DA and NE in the PFC is believed to be respon-
sible, and medications that correct this imbalance are broadly 
classified as stimulants (methylphenidate and amphet-
amines) and nonstimulants (atomoxetine, α-2 agonists, 
bupropion, and TCAs). These medications have multiple 
side effects and drug interactions, and stimulants have a 
potential for abuse if not correctly used. Hence, medications 
must be initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated upward, 
and patients must be monitored continuously for efficacy 
and emergence of side effects. Stimulants are considered as 
first-line therapy, but the first-line agent chosen is often 
patient specific, driven by the patient’s age, preference, and 
comorbidities; side effects; and drug interactions.
Given the limitations of current drugs, those that are 
highly efficacious, long acting, and devoid of abuse poten-
tial, side effects, toxicity, or drug interactions need to be 
discovered. Additionally, well-planned comparison trials of 
different drugs available need to be conducted to facilitate 
the creation of a medication algorithm that may help stan-
dardization of therapy and care for this population. The dis-
covery of a diagnostic marker of ADHD, although unlikely, 
would also aid tremendously in diagnosing this complex 
disorder.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Deﬁcits in executive functioning, including working memory (WM) deﬁcits, have been suggested to be important
in attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). During 2002 to 2003, the authors conducted a multicenter, randomized,
controlled, double-blind trial to investigate the effect of improving WM by computerized, systematic practice of WM tasks.
Method: Included in the trial were 53 children with ADHD (9 girls; 15 of 53 inattentive subtype), aged 7 to 12 years, without
stimulant medication. The compliance criterion (>20 days of training) was met by 44 subjects, 42 of whom were also eval-
uated at follow-up 3 months later. Participants were randomly assigned to use either the treatment computer program for
training WM or a comparison program. The main outcome measure was the span-board task, a visuospatial WM task that
was not part of the training program. Results: For the span-board task, there was a signiﬁcant treatment effect both post-
intervention and at follow-up. In addition, there were signiﬁcant effects for secondary outcome tasks measuring verbal WM,
response inhibition, and complex reasoning. Parent ratings showed signiﬁcant reduction in symptoms of inattention and
hyperactivity/impulsivity, both post-intervention and at follow-up. Conclusions: This study shows that WM can be improved
by training in children with ADHD. This training also improved response inhibition and reasoning and resulted in a reduction
of the parent-rated inattentive symptoms of ADHD. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2005;44(2):177–186.
Key Words: attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, intervention, working memory, response inhibition.
Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) af-
fects 3% to 5% of school-age children with serious
impairments in both academic performance and social
functioning. Many of these problems persist into adult-
hood (Biederman et al., 2000; Rasmussen and Gillberg,
2000). Deﬁcits in executive functioning, including
working memory (WM), response inhibition, and tem-
poral processing, have been suggested to play an impor-
tant role in ADHD (Barkley, 1997; Castellanos and
Tannock, 2002; Rapport et al., 2000). Executive func-
tions is a broad concept that includes, among other func-
tions, the ability to inhibit a prepotent response, planning,
reasoning, and WM. WM is the ability to retain informa-
tion during a delay and then to make a response based on
that internal representation. Furthermore, WM is often
regarded as a more fundamental function, underlying
other executive functions such as reasoning. WM deﬁcits
in ADHD have been demonstrated repeatedly (Dowson

et al., 1999; Kuntsi et al., 2001; Mariani and Barkley,

2004).
This study investigated whether systematic training
of WM tasks during a 5-week period would improve
WM, improve other executive functions, and reduce
the ADHD symptoms. Several studies have evaluated
the effect of practice with various types of cognitive tasks
in subjects with stroke (Sohlberg et al., 2000), in elderly
subjects (Ball et al., 2002), and after traumatic brain in-
jury (Salazar et al., 2000). The method evaluated in this
study differs from that of previous ones in that it focuses
entirely on training WM tasks. Moreover, the training is
computerized, which makes it possible to automatically
and continuously adapt the difﬁculty level to the perfor-
mance of the child to optimize the training effect.
The effect of WM training on brain activity was re-
cently evaluated with functional magnetic resonance im-
aging (Olesen et al., 2004). In that study, young, healthy
adult subjects were scanned while performing a WM
task and a control task before and after WM training.
Training improved the WM performance of the subjects
and resulted in increased brain activity in the dorsolat-
eral prefrontal and parietal association cortices, indicat-
ing plasticity of the neural systems underlying WM.
These cortical areas partly overlap with the prefrontal
regions implicated in ADHD pathology (Castellanos
et al., 1996, 2002; Filipek et al., 1997), and this provides
a neuroanatomical rationale for undertaking WM train-
ing in children with ADHD. A previous preliminary
study indicated that training of WM tasks can enhance
executive functioning including WM, response inhibi-
tion, and reasoning in children with ADHD (Klingberg
et al., 2002b). A major shortcoming of that study was
the low number of subjects (n = 7 in both the treatment
and the comparison groups). Moreover, ratings of
ADHD symptoms were not performed, only one clin-
ical center was involved, and there was no follow-up
measurement of both groups to estimate the extent to
which training effects lasted. The current study was
therefore conducted at four clinical sites evaluating
the effects of practice of WM tasks in a randomized,
controlled, double-blind design. Executive functions
were measured and ADHD symptoms were rated be-
fore, immediately after, and 3 months after intervention.
In this study, we compared two similar versions of the
same training program. In the treatment program, the
children practiced WM tasks in which the difﬁculty
level was adjusted to closely match the WM capacity
of the child. This procedure was hypothesized to opti-
mize the training effect. In the comparison condition,
the same tasks were used, but the WM load (i.e., num-
ber of items to be remembered) was low, thus resulting
in easy tasks that were expected to result in only small
training effects. By having two similar versions, we in-
tended to control as much as possible for nonspeciﬁc
effects of the training procedure, such as expectancy,
passage of time, and maturation and speciﬁcally estimate
the effect of improvement of WM. To evaluate the effect
of training, we used tasks that were not part of the
training program.
METHOD
Subjects
Referral sources included pediatricians, child psychiatrists, and
special teachers in schools. We included only nonmedicated children
because they were thought to have more room for clinical improve-
ment of ADHD symptoms than children on medication and there-
fore give a better chance of detecting signiﬁcant treatment effects.
Furthermore, in Sweden, only a minority of children with ADHD
receives medication.
Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of ADHD of either com-
bined or predominantly inattentive subtype, (2) age between 7
and 12 years at inclusion, and (3) access to a personal computer with
an Internet connection at home or in school. Exclusion criteria were
(1) being treated with stimulants, atomoxetine, neuroleptic, or any
other psychoactive drugs; (2) fulﬁlling criteria for diagnosis of clin-
ically signiﬁcant oppositional deﬁant disorder, autistic syndrome,
Asperger’s syndrome or depression; (3) history of seizures during
the past 2 years; (4) IQ <80 (based on an IQ test or the physician’s
clinical impression and school history); (5) motor or perceptual
handicap that would prevent using the computer program; (6)
educational level and socioeconomic situation that made it unlikely
that the family would be able to follow the treatment procedure and
study requirements (the educational level of the parents was not
speciﬁed in terms of academic degree); and (7) medical illness
requiring immediate treatment.
Of 56 patients attending the screening visit, 53 were included in
the study and randomized to the treatment or comparison programs
(Table 1, Fig. 1). Diagnostic assessment, including subtyping, had in
most cases been made before the screening visit but was conﬁrmed by
the physician and based on global clinical impression taking DSM-IV
rating scales (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) from parents
and teachers into account. None of the children fulﬁlled criteria
for conduct disorder or bipolar disorder. Two of the children had
previously taken stimulant medication but stopped more than 1 year
before the study. One child discontinued stimulant medication
1 week before the ﬁrst measurements to be able to participate in
the study. All other children had never been on medication for
ADHD.
The study was approved by the regional ethics committee at
Karolinska Hospital and by the local ethics committees at the four

participating sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participating families.
Outcome Measures
Certiﬁed psychologists performed neuropsychological assess-
ments at the four clinical sites using four tasks to evaluate executive
performance. (1) The span-board task from the WAIS-RNI testing
battery (Wechsler, 1981) was used to measure visuospatial WM.
The mean performance from trials with forward and backward re-
peating of the memoranda was used in the analysis to provide a more
reliable measure. (2) Digit-span from the WISC-III testing battery
was used to measure verbal WM. (3) The Stroop interference task
was used to measure response inhibition (Lezak, 1995). In this task
words describing colors are printed with ink in a color that was in-
congruent with the word, i.e., ‘‘green’’ printed in yellow ink. The
subjects were asked to name the color of the ink for each word. (4)
Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1995) was used to
measure nonverbal reasoning ability. Motor activity was measured
by an infrared camera that records the number of head movements
during 15 minutes of performance of a detection task on a computer
(Teicher et al., 1996).
The 18 DSM-IV items were used as a rating scale for ADHD
symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). We also used
the Conners Rating Scale for parents and teachers (revised, short
version) (Conners, 2001). Symptoms were scored by assigning a se-
verity estimate for each symptom on a 4-point scale, from 0 (not at
all) to 3 (very much). Because there are no updated Swedish norms
for these scales, raw values were used and reported.
Before the study was conducted, the span-board task was deﬁned
to be the main outcome measure because it provides a nontrained
measure of visuospatial WM. The stimuli, presentation, and re-
sponse mode for this task differ from the WM tasks that were part
of the training program (see Discussion).
Intervention
The treatment consisted of performing WM tasks implemented in
a computer program developed for this study (RoboMemo,
Cogmed Cognitive Medical Systems AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
The program was provided on a CD and used by the child on a per-
sonal computer either at home or in school. The program included
visuospatial WM tasks (remembering the position of objects in a 4 3 4
grid as well as verbal tasks (remembering phonemes, letters, or digits)
(see Olesen et al., 2004) for further description of the visuospatial
tasks). Responses were made by clicking on displays with the com-
puter mouse. The children performed 90 WM trials on each day of
training. Total time depended on the level and time between trials.
Medium total training time (excluding breaks) was about 40
minutes. The difﬁculty level was automatically adjusted, on a trial-
by-trial basis, to match the WM span of the child on each task.
Responses to each trial were logged to a ﬁle on the computer, and
every 1 to 2 days, an adult used a report program to upload the log
ﬁle via the Internet to a server so that compliance could be veriﬁed.
The comparison condition was identical to the treatment except
that the difﬁculty of the 90 WM trials remained on the initial low
level (two to three items) instead of being increased to match the
WM span of the child. As in the treatment program, responses were
logged to a ﬁle that was uploaded to a server to verify compliance.
Procedures
Children were recruited via pediatricians, child psychiatrists, and
special teachers. Initial information was given verbally. Families ex-
pressing interest in participating in the study were sent the detailed
written information about the study, together with DSM-IV ques-
tions about ADHD and oppositional deﬁant disorder, and Conners
rating scales, to be answered before the screening visit. The written
information stated that there would be two interventions and that
one of them probably was more effective than the other. The written
information also speciﬁed the inclusion criteria regarding diagnosis,
medication, age, and the need for a computer with Internet access. At

the screening visit, the physician met both the child and one parent
and checked all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included chil-
dren were scheduled for baseline evaluation (= time point 1 [T1]) at
which a psychologist administered the tests and provided the CD
with the computer program. They were shown how to install the
program and asked to complete at least 25 days of training before
the next visit.
A randomized, blinded list of numbers associated with the CDs
containing the treatment or comparison program was sent to each
clinical center. Randomization was done with blocks of four. The
CDs were distributed by the testing psychologists to the children
in the order that they entered the study at each site. Thus, the phy-
sician, psychologist, parent, and child were all blinded to child group
status until after the follow-up assessment. Once every week, a certiﬁed
psychologist (not afﬁliated with any of the testing sites) called the par-
ents and asked about technical difﬁculties and gave feedback about
how many days of training that had been uploaded to the server. This
was intended to increase compliance. The postintervention visit (T2)
took place 5 to 6 weeks after the baseline visit, and the follow-up as-
sessment (T3) was done 3 months after T2. On both occasions, the
psychologist again administered the neuropsychological tests and dis-
tributed rating scales that were completed at home by the parent and
teacher and mailed to the study coordinator. The study was conducted
during 2002, with follow-up during 2003.
Statistical Analysis
Hypotheses were tested by comparing outcome score at later times
(T2 or T3) for the two groups using a general linear model, controlling
for age, number of days of program use, and baseline score (T1). This
analysis is equivalent to a between-group analysis of covariance with
baseline as a covariate. We also controlled for the location where
the intervention took place (home or school) when analyzing ratings
from teacher and parent. Analyses showed no effect of gender or clinical
site for any of the variables, and these two covariates were therefore not
included in the further analyses. One-tailed tests were used because all
hypotheses were based on the preliminary study (Klingberg et al.,
2002b), and only the superiority of treatment over comparison was
of interest. Analyses were done using SAS v8.02 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The ﬂow of participants is shown in Figure 1. Of the
53 subjects, three withdrew: two because of computer
problems and one because of social problems not related
to the study. Fifty children attended the postintervention
visit. The criterion for sufﬁcient compliance was deﬁned
before the study to be 20 or more days of program use.
Forty-four of the 50 subjects met these criteria. Mean
number of days was 26.6 (SD = 2.6) in the comparison
group and 25.2 (SD = 2.2) in the treatment group.
In the analysis of rating scales, missing values were
not imputed in the regression analysis. Hence, only pa-
tients with complete data were included in the model.
The main reason for missing values was that parents or
teachers failed to mail the rating scales to the study co-
ordinator. The regression analyses of rating scale data
were thus based on a smaller number of observations:
36 from parents, 34 from teachers at T2, and 37 from
parents and 35 from teachers at T3. To check for any
selection bias, we compared patients with complete rat-
ing data with those with missing data and found no sig-
niﬁcant differences in baseline values from the rating
scales. Subjects with missing data were also evenly dis-
tributed between the two groups (Tables 1 and 2).
Executive Tasks
Raw data (not corrected for the covariates) are shown
in Table 2. Mean values corrected for covariates (includ-
ing baseline measurement) are shown in Figure 2. The
results of the statistical analysis are shown in Table 3.
For the main outcome measure, the span-board task,
there was a signiﬁcantly greater improvement from
baseline to postintervention measurement in the treat-
ment group compared with the comparison group (Fig.
2A, Table 3). At follow-up, the treatment effect was still
signiﬁcant. The effect size (Cohen’s delta [Cohen, 1988])
was calculated from corrected values (Fig. 2, Tab. 3) and
was 0.93 post-intervention and 0.92 (99%) at follow-up.
Other executive tasks were considered secondary out-
come measures. There was a signiﬁcant treatment effect
for all executive tasks (Table 3). The faster performance
on the Stroop task was not due to a prioritizing of speed
while sacriﬁcing accuracy because the treatment group
was not only faster but also more accurate (Table 2).
Effect sizes were 0.59, 0.34, and 0.45 for the digit-span,
Stroop time, and Raven’s task, respectively.
At follow-up, the performance in the treatment
group was about as high as, or higher than, at post-
intervention (Table 2, Fig. 2B–D). The effect sizes
were 0.57, 0.25, and 0.30 for the digit-span, Stroop
time, and Raven’s task, respectively. This corresponds
to 97%, 73%, and 67%, respectively, of the postinter-
vention effect. The ability to detect the remaining sig-
niﬁcant effect for the Raven’s task and for accuracy in
the Stroop task was limited by the ceiling effects, which
were more pronounced for the treatment group. Post-
intervention, eight subjects (40%) in the treatment group
had a score of 34 to 36 on the Raven’s task, for which
36 is the maximal score. In the comparison group, the
corresponding number was 1 (4%). There was neither
signiﬁcant baseline-score-by-treatment interaction nor
any signiﬁcant ADHD-subtype-by-treatment interaction

for any variable (neither for the executive tasks or the
rating scales). All signiﬁcant differences remained signif-
icant also when ADHD subtype was included as a covar-
iate in the analyses.
Ratings of ADHD Symptoms
In the parent ratings of ADHD symptoms (according
to DSM-IV ), there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the
inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores (Table
3). The rating scores from the teachers were not signif-
icant (Table 2). Effect sizes (from corrected values) for
the signiﬁcant comparisons were 1.21 for parent-rated
attention at T2, and 0.67 at T3. For parent-rated hy-
peractivity + impulsivity, it was 0.42 both at T2 and
T3. It should be noted that these effect sizes are based
on differences relative to a comparison group that was
not passive but received a form of low-dose treatment.
From Conners rating scales, the Parent Rating Scale
showed a signiﬁcant decrease for parent ratings of op-
positional symptoms at follow-up (n = 35, p = .02) of
hyperactivity symptoms, post-intervention (n = 36, p =
.03), and at follow-up (n = 35, p = .002) and of the
ADHD index at follow-up (n = 35, p = .02). Other com-
parisons were not signiﬁcant.
Noncompliers

excluded because of noncompliance (<20 days of practice),

we also performed an analysis in which we included all
subjects for whom we had outcome measures at T2
(n = 50). All tests that were signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst analysis
(span-board, digit-span, Stroop time, Raven’s task, parent
ratings of attention and hyperactivity) were also signiﬁcant
when the additional six subjects were included (p < .05).
Adverse Events
At the time of testing after intervention and at
follow-up, parents and children were asked about any
adverse events that could be related to the intervention.
There were none.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the treatment group that undertook
high-intensity training of WM improved signiﬁcantly
more than the comparison group on the main outcome
measure: the span-board task, which was a nonpracticed
measure of visuospatial WM. This effect also remained
at follow-up. In addition, there were treatment effects

for response inhibition (Stroop task), verbal WM
(digit-span), complex reasoning (Raven’s task), and
for parent ratings of ADHD symptoms.
The span-board task differs from the trained visuo-
spatial WM tasks with respect to the stimuli that are
used (blocks on a board versus circles lighting up and
disappearing on a screen), stimulus conﬁguration (10
irregularly positioned blocks versus 16 boxes in a regular
4 3 4 grid) as well as response mode (pointing versus
using the computer mouse), and the testing situation
(interacting with a person versus a computer). The im-
provement on the span-board task is therefore evidence
that the training effect generalized to a nontrained vi-
suospatial WM task. The treatment effect (b in Table
3) corresponds to a 19% improvement, and the effect
size was 0.93. The effect of stimulant medication, by
comparison, has in different studies improved visuospa-
tial WM with effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (Barnett
et al., 2001), 0.4 to 1.2 (Bedard et al., 2004), and 0.4 to
0.7 (Kempton et al., 1999). The effect of training on
visuospatial WM was thus fully comparable with that
of medication. Comparisons with previous studies of
WM in children with and without ADHD suggests that
the treatment-related improvement brought the chil-
dren’s WM performance as close as 0 to 0.3 SD below
that of the rest of the population (Barnett et al., 2001;
Kempton et al., 1999; Mariani and Barkley, 1997;
Westerberg et al., 2004). Although tasks such as the
span-board task are laboratory tasks and it can be dif-
ﬁcult to see the usefulness in everyday life of an increase
in WM span, it is known that WM capacity underlies
a wide range of cognitive abilities, including reasoning
and control of attention (Engle et al., 1999) and the
ability to resist distraction from irrelevant stimuli (de
Fockert et al., 2001). It has also been suggested that def-
icits in nonverbal WM in children with ADHD con-
tributes to the inability to hold events in mind and
to defective planning (Barkley, 1997).
The three other executive tasks (digit-span, Stroop
task, and Raven’s task) were secondary outcome mea-
sures, and the outcome of the statistical tests for these
tasks should therefore be interpreted cautiously. How-
ever, group differences for Raven’s task and the Stroop
task were also found in the preliminary study of children
with ADHD (Klingberg et al., 2002b) as well as in
a study of WM training in adults (Olesen et al.,
2004). Together, these results indicate that the effect
of WM training also transfers to nontrained executive
tasks other than WM tasks. The training program did
not include any problem-solving task or any response
inhibition task even remotely similar to the Stroop task
or Raven’s task. The Stroop task measures the ability to
inhibit a prepotent response. A review has also shown
this task to be a sensitive task for measuring cognitive
impairments in ADHD (Barkley et al., 1992). Also in
regard to this task, comparison with previous studies
suggests that the training brought the children’s perfor-
mance to less than 0.3 SD from the population mean

(Nigg et al., 2002; Willcutt et al., 2001). The improve-
ment in reasoning ability after training of WM is con-
sistent with the psychological literature, suggesting that
WM is necessary for reasoning ability (Engle et al.,
1999) and that visuospatial WM correlates highly with
performance on Raven’s task (Fry and Hale, 1996).
Neuroanatomically, this association could be explained
by overlapping parts of cortex in the prefrontal and
parietal lobe used for WM and reasoning (Gray
et al., 2003). Visuospatial WM and response inhibition
also have neuroanatomical commonalities. The same
areas in the superior part of the prefrontal cortex and
in the parietal cortex underlie development of both vi-
suospatial WM capacity (Klingberg et al., 2002a) and
performance of the Stroop task (Adleman et al.,
2002). Overlapping neural systems could thus explain
how training of visuospatial WM could generalize to
reasoning and response inhibition. This interpretation
is also supported by the ﬁnding that training of WM
tasks increase brain activity in multimodal areas of
the prefrontal and parietal cortices (Olesen et al., 2004).
The WM training had a very strong effect on parent-
rated attention but not on teacher ratings. We have no
clear explanation for this discrepancy at this time. We
have no data on how much time that the teachers spent
with the children each day or each week. It has been
shown that interrater correlations are often low (Swanson
et al., 2001), and a twofold difference in the effect sizes
from parents and teachers is also seen in other studies
(Wolraich et al., 2001). Cultural differences in teacher
ratings have also been reported (Magnusson et al.,
1999). This, combined with a modest number of subjects
and some missing data, could result in some discrepancies
just from random variability. However, many of the
symptoms of inattention are closely related to executive
functions and we see the signiﬁcant ratings from parents
as more reliable because they are consistent with the
changes measured in the objective tests of executive func-
tioning.
Although ratings from parents also showed signiﬁ-
cant effects for symptoms related to hyperactivity, this
was not conﬁrmed by any signiﬁcant decrease in the
number of measured head movements (Table 3, Fig.
2E). The reason for this is unclear. Additional objective
measures of hyperactivity could have been useful.
Guidelines have been proposed, according to which
an effect size (Cohen’s delta) of 0.2 represents a weak,
0.5 a moderate, and 0.8 a strong clinical effect (Cohen,
1988; Swanson et al., 2001). By that standard, the train-
ing resulted in a strong clinical effect for the main out-
come measure (span-board) as well as for parent ratings
of inattentive symptoms.
Limitations
More studies will be needed to conﬁrm the training
effects in other populations and to answer additional
questions about the mechanisms underlying training-
induced improvements of WM. Although oppositional
deﬁant disorder symptoms were present in many chil-
dren, we excluded children fulﬁlling the diagnostic
criteria for oppositional deﬁant disorder, and this limits
the generalizability of the ﬁndings. A standardized psy-
chiatric interview, as it is deﬁned in the United States,
was not performed. However, the interviews followed
a prespeciﬁed protocol and all clinicians had many years
of experience in diagnosing ADHD. One limitation of
this study was the modest number of subjects. Additional
follow-up measurements would also have been useful.
In the current study, the follow-up time was limited by
ethical considerations about the comparison group, who
needed to be without intervention for the entire
follow-up period. We have not evaluated the effect of
combining medication with training, which will need
to be done in the future. However, the previous prelim-
inary study (Klingberg et al., 2002b) included children
on medication. These children also improved, although
the relative training effect on and off medication was
not statistically evaluated because of the small sample
size. Furthermore, in studies of motor training, amphet-
amine enhances training-induced plasticity (Buteﬁsch
et al., 2002).
Although the training effect remained relatively sta-
ble for several months, we expect that it will eventually
be necessary with a shorter period of retraining to main-
tain the effect. However, if WM and executive functions
improve by practice, as this study indicates, then we
would expect some degree of practice effect also from
everyday activities with very high WM loads, such as
mathematics and other demanding academic activities.
It is theoretically possible that improvement of WM
and executive functioning by an intensive training pro-
gram would enable the children to perform better and
hence to participate more in such WM demanding
activities. This would lead to more WM practice in
everyday life, and the children would enter a positive

feedback loop that would reduce the need for retraining
with a training program.
Clinical Implications
This study shows that WM can be improved by train-
ing. In addition, we saw effects on reasoning, response
inhibition, and a decrease in parent-rated symptoms of
ADHD. The subjects that would be expected to beneﬁt
from training of WM are presumably those individuals
for whom executive deﬁcits and inattention problems
constitute a bottleneck for everyday functioning or
academic performance. These individuals could be
found both in the inattentive and combined subgroup
of ADHD (Chhabildas et al., 2001). It is also possible
that training of WM will be useful in other conditions
in which WM deﬁcits are prominent, such as after trau-
matic brain injury and stroke affecting the frontal lobe.

34501798,True,True,"(1) Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) constitutes one of the leading mental health and behavioral disorders in childhood and adolescence. The main objective of this study was to analyze the time trend in the incidence of ADHD diagnoses in Navarre (Spain) from 2003 to 2019 in children and adolescents from 5 to 19 years old. Additionally, the seasonal trends of ADHD incidence and ADHD prevalence were determined. (2) Methods: A population-based observational retrospective study, which included people born between 1991 and 2011 and who attended compulsory education between 2007 and 2017 in Navarre (Spain), was carried out with data from both the Education and Health Department databases. (3) Results: The incidence rate increased from 4.18 cases per 1000 person-years in 2003 to 7.43 cases per 1000 person-years in 2009, before decreasing progressively to 2.1 cases per 1000 person-years in 2019. A peak incidence rate at 7-8 years of age was observed, which is consistent across the study period and for both genders. Males were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females, with similar time trends in both. A seasonal pattern in ADHD diagnosis was found, with peaks in February-March and the lowest rates in the summer months. Inattentive cases were much more frequent than hyperactive cases, whereas combined cases remained low across the study period. (4) Conclusions: In this age-period-cohort analysis, a clear period and age effect was observed. We found a decreasing trend in the ADHD incidence rate since 2015. Further research is needed to confirm whether a change of trend is occurring globally.",

The second purpose is to provide information and suggestions about treating children who stutter and who have been diagnosed with ADHD. Specific information is provided regarding medication used to treat ADHD symptoms as well as the minimal documented evidence of its impact on stuttering. Suggestions for educational, behavioral, and cognitive management of children who stutter and have ADHD also are discussed.",

ecause depression and painful symptoms commonly occur together, we conducted a
literature review to determine the prevalence of both conditions and the effects of co-
morbidity on diagnosis, clinical outcomes, and treatment. The prevalences of pain in
depressed cohorts and depression in pain cohorts are higher than when these condi-
tions are individually examined. The presence of pain negatively affects the recognition and treat-
ment of depression. When pain is moderate to severe, impairs function, and/or is refractory to treat-
ment, it is associated with more depressive symptoms and worse depression outcomes (eg, lower
quality of life, decreased work function, and increased health care utilization). Similarly, depres-
sion in patients with pain is associated with more pain complaints and greater impairment. De-
pression and pain share biological pathways and neurotransmitters, which has implications for
the treatment of both concurrently. A model that incorporates assessment and treatment of de-
pression and pain simultaneously is necessary for improved outcomes.

Individually, depression and pain symp-
toms are highly prevalent conditions en-
countered by primary care physicians and
specialists. Epidemiologic studies indi-
cate that the lifetime prevalence of pain
symptoms (eg, joint pain, back pain, head-
ache, chest pain, arm or leg pain, and ab-
dominal pain) ranges from 24% to 37%1
and that physical symptoms such as pain
are the leading reason that patients seek
medical care.2,3 Major depression is also
common, with prevalence in primary care
patients of 5% to 10%.4 This underesti-
mates the true impact of depression, since
many more people have depressive symp-
toms but do not fully meet the major de-
pressive disorder diagnostic criteria of the
American Psychiatric Association’s Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, Fourth Edition for duration or num-
ber of symptoms. Depression has become
the fourth leading cause of disability world-
wide and is projected to become even more
burdensome in the future.5
A growing body of literature has fo-
cused on the interaction between depres-
sion and pain symptoms. This interac-
tion has been labeled by some authors as
the depression-pain syndrome6 or depres-
sion-pain dyad, implying that the condi-
tions often coexist, respond to similar treat-
ments, exacerbate one another, and share
biological pathways and neurotransmit-
ters.7,8 Patients with depression often pre-
sent with a complex set of overlapping
symptoms, including emotional and physi-
cal complaints. Physical complaints typi-
cally include medically unexplained pain.9
Although it is generally understood that
depression and painful symptoms are com-
mon comorbidities and that their combi-
nation is costlier and more disabling than

either condition alone, their inter-
action is not fully understood. Un-
derstanding this relationship has be-
come more important, given that
primary care physicians fail to ac-
curately diagnose at least 50% of pa-
tients with major depression,10 and
at least 2 studies have shown that pa-
tients with depression who present
with physical symptoms such as pain
are particularly likely to receive an
inaccurate diagnosis.11,12 Patients
with depression have significantly
more unexplained physical symp-
toms such as pain and fatigue and
utilize more health resources than
nondepressed patients. The new em-
phasis on pain as the fifth vital sign
by the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Orga-
nizations and the Veterans Health
Administration highlights the im-
portance of a better understanding
of the likely reciprocal links be-
tween depression and pain.
The present review addresses
the following 6 questions: (1) What
is the prevalence of pain symptoms
in patients with depression and, con-
versely, what is the prevalence of de-
pression in patients with pain com-
plaints? (2) Does the presence of
pain affect provider recognition and
treatment of depression? (3) Does
the presence of pain affect depres-
sion outcomes such as functional
limitations, quality of life, health care
costs and utilization, and treat-
ment efficacy? (4) Does the pres-
ence of depression affect these same
clinical outcomes in patients treated
for pain? (5) Is antidepressant treat-
ment for painful symptoms and co-
morbid depression effective? and (6)
What are the common biological
pathways and implications for treat-
ment choice when depression and
pain coexist?
METHODS
We searched the MEDLINE database
from 1966 through July 30, 2002, us-
ing the combined search terms depres-
sion or depressive disorders and pain. Ar-
ticles were also identified by a manual
search of bibliographies from all re-
trieved articles. Studies were limited to
humanstudiesreportedinEnglish.Afew
abstracts, studies not published in full,
and book chapters were included. Two
of us (M.J.B. and K.K.) independently
screened titles and abstracts and reached
agreement on which articles to re-
trieve. All primary and review articles
were examined for information perti-
nent to our questions.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if
they addressed both depression and pain
symptoms. Specific symptoms (eg, head-
ache, back pain, neck pain, extremity/
joint pain, chest pain, pelvic pain, ab-
dominal pain, and others) as well as
general pain (ie, studies that used pain
measures but did not specify pain loca-
tion) were included in the analysis. Ar-
ticles were included if they had primary
data derived from clinical trials or lon-
gitudinal or cross-sectional studies. Ex-
cludedstudieswerethoseaddressingpain
due to specific disease processes (eg, pe-
ripheral neuropathy, rheumatoid arthri-
tis, or cancer pain) or symptom syn-
dromes (eg, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel
syndrome, or migraine headache) be-
causetheseconditionshavebeenthesub-
ject of previous reviews.13-20
Because of the broad scope of de-
pression and painful symptoms, the va-
riety of measures used to assess depres-
sion, and the different study definitions
of pain, formal meta-analytic methods
were precluded. Instead, this review is
a qualitative and semiquantitative syn-
thesis of the relevant, representative, and
evidence-based literature.

A large longitudinal cohort
study has shown that depressive
symptoms predict future episodes of
low back pain, neck-shoulder pain,
and musculoskeletal symptoms
compared with those patients with-
out depressive symptoms at base-
line.34 Another study showed that
low back pain is more than 2 times
as likely to be reported by individu-
als with depressive symptoms com-
pared with those without depres-
sive symptoms.35 In addition, the
specific complaints of headache, ab-
dominal pain, joint pain, and chest
pain are frequently reported by pa-
tients with depression in primary
care settings25,36 and by elderly nurs-
ing home residents.37
WHAT IS THE PREVALENCE
OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IN
PAIN PATIENTS?
Several reviews38-42 have examined
the prevalence of major depression
in patients with pain. Table 2
summarizes 42 studies6,36,43-82 iden-
tified by our literature search. Fif-
teen studies were from pain clinics
or inpatient pain programs; 9 from
psychiatric clinics or psychiatric
consultation; 3 from arthritis,
rheumatology, or orthopedic clin-
ics (excluding rheumatoid arthritis
and fibromyalgia studies); 3 from
dental/facial pain clinics; 2 from
surgical patients; and 10 from pri-
mary care or population-based set-
tings. Most studies (n=31) focused
on “chronic” pain complaints of at
least 6 months’ duration.
The mean (range) prevalence
rates for concurrent major depres-
sion in patients identified as hav-
ing pain by study setting are as fol-
lows: 52% (1.5%-100%) in pain
clinics or inpatient pain programs;
38% (6%-64%) in psychiatric clin-
ics or psychiatric consultation; 56%
(21%-89%) in orthopedic clinics or
rheumatology clinics (excluding
studies focusing on fibromyalgia or
rheumatoid arthritis); 85% (35%-
100%) in dental clinics addressing
facial pain; 13% (12%-17%) in gy-
necology clinics addressing chronic
pelvic pain in laparoscopy patients;
18% (4.7%-22%) in population-
based settings; and 27% (5.9%-
46%) in primary care clinics. In ad-
dition to the point prevalence rates
listed in Table 2, two studies54,73 also
reported the lifetime prevalence of
major depression in pain patients.
Rates of depression increased from
12% to 32%73 and 32.4% to 56.8%,54
respectively. When the etiology of
the pain condition is considered,
studies of more defined pain disor-
ders (eg, peripheral neuropathy) re-
port lower occurrence of depres-
sion than studies of medically
unexplained pain.61
A variety of instruments were
used to diagnose depression, includ-
ing the Beck Depression Inventory,
Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale, Primary Care
Evaluation for Mental Disorders,
Geriatric Depression Scale, Feigh-
ner criteria, and Hopkins Symptom
Checklist. Pain was assessed mainly
through clinical interview or differ-
ent pain questionnaires. The sub-
stantial variation in prevalence rates
is likely related to differences in di-
agnostic criteria used for depres-
sion,painconditionsexamined,study
designs, and subject populations.
Severalstudieshavereportedthe
association between depression and
pain,specificallyaddressinghowthe
riskofdepressionincreasesasafunc-
tion of different aspects of worsen-
ingpain(eg,severity,frequency,du-
ration, and number of symptoms).
Patientswithmultiplepainsymptoms
(eg,backpain,headache,abdominal
pain, chest pain, and facial pain) are
3 to 5 times more likely to be de-
pressedthanpatientswithoutpain,81
and pain symptoms are associated
with at least a 2-fold increased risk
forcoexistingdepression.83Addition-
ally,apopulation-basedstudyshowed
that subjects with chronic pain (de-
finedaspainformostdaysforatleast

depression criteria as those without

severityofpainincreases,depressive
symptomsanddepressiondiagnoses
become more prevalent.75,77,84 Like-
wise, as depression symptoms in-
creaseinseverity,paincomplaintsare
reported more often.81
Consistent with findings in pri-
mary care patients,36 multiple pain
complaints increase the probability
of depression38 such that patients
with 2 or more different pain com-
plaints are 6 times more likely to be
depressed, and patients with 3 or
more pain complaints are 8 times
more likely to meet depression cri-
teria.10 In addition, more frequent
pain episodes85 and longer pain du-
ration are associated with depres-
sion. An international study showed
that patients with pain lasting longer
than 6 months were more than 4
times as likely to have a depressive
disorder as those without chronic
pain.86 The long-term medical con-
ditions most strongly associated lon-
gitudinally with the development of
incident depression included back
pain and migraine headaches.87
DOES THE PRESENCE OF PAIN
AFFECT PROVIDER
RECOGNITION AND
TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION?
Fourteen studies sought to deter-
mine whether the presence of pain
affected provider recognition of de-
pression. In depression studies not
addressing pain, at least half of pa-
tients with major depression were
not properly diagnosed and there-
fore not treated for depression in pri-
mary care settings.11,88 Although
many factors account for this prob-
lem, the most important reason re-
lates to how the patient presents. The
“typical” depression presentation in
primary care is dominated by physi-
cal (somatic) complaints as op-
posed to psychological complaints.
More than 50% of patients with de-
pression report somatic complaints
only11,12,24,89-92 and at least 60% of
these somatic complaints are pain re-
lated.24,25,36,93 Thus, patients with de-
pression in primary care settings are
more likely to report various pain
symptoms than they are to present
with dysphoric mood or anhedo-
nia. Physical (or somatic) symp-
toms of depression, specifically fa-
tigue,
insomnia,
and
pain
complaints, are more numerous in
patients with depression, are fre-
quently nonspecific,91,94 and are of-

ten unrelated to a known organic
disease process.3
The patient’s presentation of
physical complaints (and the promi-
nence of pain symptoms) inter-
feres with the recognition of depres-
sion for patients in primary care
settings. Presentation of progres-
sively more physical complaints re-
duces depression recognition11,12 be-
cause patients and their medical
providers (at least initially) often as-
sociate these symptoms with an un-
derlying medical illness instead of an
underlying depressive disorder. Pre-
vious work has shown that if all pri-
mary care patients presenting with
a variety of pain conditions (eg, ab-
dominal pain, headache, joint pain,
and back pain) were evaluated for
possible depression, 60% of previ-
ously undetected depression cases
could have been recognized.95 Pa-
tients having multiple presenting
physical complaints, including non-
specific musculoskeletal com-
plaints and back pain, had more un-
derlying depressive symptoms.96
Additionally, patients presenting
with somatic complaints are more
likely to have subclinical and milder
cases of depression that negatively
affect recognition: milder cases of de-

pression are more difficult to de-
tect than more severe and blatant
cases, and patients with milder cases
are more likely to present to pri-
mary care providers than to psychia-
trists.
Few studies focused on how
pain plays a role in depression treat-
ment considerations. For example,
patients often attribute their pain-
ful physical symptoms to an under-
lying medical illness and want treat-
ment for their pain. Health care
providers frequently accept the pa-
tient’s request for pain treatment,
while neglecting treatment for the
patient’s underlying depression.
Fritzsche et al97 noticed that pa-
tients with depression and pain who
lacked psychological attribution to
their illness were offered less psy-
chosocial treatment, experienced
worse outcomes, and received more
medications and physical therapy.
Only older studies addressed
how specific medication practices
were influenced by pain in patients
with depression. For example, opi-
oid analgesics were more com-
monly prescribed than antidepres-
sants in a sample of patients with
depression and chronic pain,98 and
there were no differences in seda-
tive and antidepressant medica-
tions used in chronic pain patients
with and without depression.48 As a
result, patients with chronic pain are
at risk for polypharmacy, adverse
drug events, and narcotic and/or
benzodiazepine dependence or ad-
diction.99,100
DOES THE PRESENCE OF PAIN
AFFECT DEPRESSION
OUTCOMES?
Outcomes included depression se-
verity and secondary measures such
as functional status, quality of life,
health care costs and utilization, and
treatment efficacy. Unfortunately,
most depression and pain studies
have either been cross-sectional or
have assessed the prognostic value
of depression for poor pain out-
comes. Relatively few studies have
specifically addressed how the pres-
ence of pain affects depression out-
comes. Most work in this area has
been performed by Von Korff et al81
showing that the presence of up to
5 different pain complaints (abdomi-
nal pain, headache, back pain, chest
pain, and facial pain) is associated
with increased symptoms of depres-
sion. Further study demonstrated
that progressive pain severity at base-
line was associated with poor de-
pression outcomes, including more
severe depression, more pain-
related functional limitations, worse
self-rated health, higher unemploy-
ment rate, more frequent use of opi-
oid analgesics, and more frequent
pain-related doctor visits (at base-
line and 1-year follow-up).101 Inter-
ference with daily activities due to
pain, the number of days in pain
(within a 6-month period), and the
diffuseness of pain (or number of
pain sites) also predicted the sever-
ity of depression.102 Unimproved
back pain at short-term (7-week)
and long-term (2-year) follow-up
was associated with significantly
more depressive symptoms and
chronic depression when com-
pared with patients whose back pain
improved.101,103,104 Over the long
term, improvement in pain symp-
toms was associated with a de-
crease in depressive symptoms to
nearly normal.81
When evaluated by changes in
physical symptoms, psychiatric
symptoms, and functional out-
comes, patients without painful
physical symptoms were found to
have better depression outcomes.105
In a sample of 217 patients with de-
pression, pain was experienced on
more than half the days over a
3-month period, producing 16 days
when usual activities were cur-
tailed, 4 days missed from school or
work, and at least 1 visit with a phy-
sician or clinical nurse.106 Retrospec-
tive studies suggest that patients with
depression have significantly more
clinic visits, phone calls to the clinic,
and hospitalizations for pain-
relatedsymptomsinthemonthslead-
ing up to a diagnosis of depres-
sion.107,108 A population-based study
found that persons with depression
and concomitant pain initiated 20%
more visits to medical providers and
their total medical costs were higher
than persons with depression but
withoutpain.109 Althoughsomestud-
ies suggest that patients with depres-
sion and comorbid chronic low back
pain respond just as well (eg, fewer
depression symptoms) to antidepres-
sants and cognitive behavioral
therapy as depressed patients with-
out back pain, little is known about
how or if pain complicates depres-
sion outcomes.110,111 Bair et al21 sug-
gest that baseline pain reduces the
benefits of antidepressant therapy at
12 weeks in terms of depression and
other quality-of-life outcomes, but
more prospective studies are needed
to better quantify this.
Thegoalofdepressiontreatment
is complete symptom resolution or
remission.Lingeringphysicalsymp-
tomsinpatientswithdepressionmay

mission of their depression. Cur-
rently,upto70%ofpatientsrespond

clinical study114 found that 76% of

gering symptoms of depression re-
lapsedwithin10months.Ofthesepa-
tients who experienced lingering
symptoms, 94% had mild to moder-
ate physical complaints.114

OF DEPRESSION AFFECT
CLINICAL OUTCOMES
IN PATIENTS TREATED
FOR PAIN?
We identified 22 studies* that ad-
dressed how depression or depres-
sive symptoms affect outcomes in
patients with pain (Table 3). Ten
of the studies were based in man-
aged care or other primary care set-
tings, 6 in pain and/or specialty clin-
ics, 4 were population-based, 1 study
was conducted at a worksite, and 1
in surgical patients. The most com-
mon pain condition examined was
low back pain. Depression was as-
sociated with an array of poor pain
outcomes and worse prognosis. Pa-
tients with pain and comorbid de-
pression experienced more pain
complaints,89 more intense pain,77
more amplification of pain symp-
toms,82 and longer duration of
pain.116 Unfortunately patients with
both conditions were more likely to
have persistent pain116,120,123,125 and

symptoms in patients with low back
pain also increased health care uti-
lization. Higher depressive symp-
toms were associated with more pri-
mary care follow-up visits for back
pain, more back pain–related radio-
graphs, more pain medication re-
fills, and higher total costs.89 “Poor
outcomes” were observed at short-
term (7 weeks) and long-term (1
year) follow-up.103 In surgical pa-
tients, those with higher preopera-
tive depression scores experienced
greater postoperative pain.126
Some studies35,116 and a litera-
ture review by Linton128 have sug-
gested that depression has a greater
impact than other clinical factors on
outcomes, especially functional im-
pairment, in patients with pain, and
that neglecting to treat the depres-
sion accounts for some of the pain
treatment failures.38,52 Patients with
depression and chronic pain were
less likely to comply with pain re-
habilitation and thus more likely to
relapse following treatment.121,122 Al-
though most studies (Table 3) sup-
port the finding that patients with
pain and depression have poorer
overall response to treatment than
pain patients without depression, a
few did not report such a relation-
ship.55,121,129,130
IS ANTIDEPRESSANT
TREATMENT FOR PAINFUL
SYMPTOMS AND COMORBID
DEPRESSION EFFECTIVE?
Feinmann131 has previously re-
viewed studies that reported pain re-
lief associated with depression symp-
tom relief. We identified 22
studies6,71,132-151 that examined anti-
depressant efficacy for treating pain
symptoms and subsequent depres-
sion response (Table 4). We did not
include studies of symptom syn-
dromes (eg, fibromyalgia, irritable
bowel syndrome, migraine head-
aches) or studies excluding pa-
tients with depression or organic
pain (eg, diabetic neuropathy, can-
cer pain) because these conditions
have been reviewed previously, and
antidepressants were found to be ef-
fective.18-20,152,153 The primary out-
come in all the studies in Table 4 was
pain relief or other pain outcomes,
while depression symptom relief was
one of the secondary outcomes.
Sample sizes were relatively small,
ranging from 14 to 253. Only 4 stud-
ies6,132,137,141 were conducted in a pri-
mary care setting, with the remain-
der situated in pain, psychiatric, and
specialty clinics. The intervention
arm of each selected study usually
involved tricyclic antidepressants,
and only 4 studies involved selec-
tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs)135,138,143,145 to assess pain and
depression. While most of the stud-
ies demonstrated improvement in
both pain and depression symp-
toms, a few of the studies132,142,147
failed to show symptom relief.
Whether SSRIs improve painful
symptoms associated with depres-
sion is unsettled. Most studies were
uncontrolled, of short duration (av-
eraging 9 weeks), and used doses
that were subtherapeutic for ad-
equate depression treatment.

treated, the patient’s somatic symp-
toms, particularly pain complaints,
are also relieved.59,88 In a 6-week
clinical trial comparing fluoxetine
with placebo, outpatients with ma-
jor depression who were treated with
active medication had significant im-
provements in functional health, in-
cluding painful symptoms, com-
pared with the placebo group.154
However, a trial investigating a col-
laborative management program for
depression vs usual care showed sig-
nificantly fewer somatization symp-
toms at follow-up but no signifi-
cant intervention effect on pain
symptoms.155 A relatively recent
meta-analysis153 of antidepressant
use in treating symptom syn-
dromes and unexplained symp-
toms found that symptom improve-
ment did not usually correlate with
depression response in the studies
where both pain and depression
were assessed. Only a third of stud-
ies showed improvement in physi-
cal symptoms in concert with
depression response. Similarly,
a review of cognitive-behavioral
therapy for somatic symptoms
showed an effect on somatic symp-
toms that appeared, at least in part,
independent of an effect on psycho-
logical distress.156 Several studies
have examined the use of SSRIs in
pain syndromes such as diabetic
neuropathy and fibromyalgia, but
few of these have assessed changes
in both pain and depression.157 On
the other hand, Ward et al32 re-
ported that the degree of depres-
sion improvement correlated with
the amount of pain relief. Other
studies have suggested that the com-
bination of antidepressants and cog-
nitive behavioral therapy may be ef-
fective in treating patients with both
chronic pain and depression.6,44,47
WHAT ARE THE COMMON
BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS FOR
DEPRESSION AND PAIN, AND
WHAT ARE THE
IMPLICATIONS FOR
TREATMENT?
The biochemical theory of depres-
sion posits that depression is the re-
sult of a neurochemical imbalance or
a functional deficiency of key neu-
rotransmitters, the monoamines:
serotonin, norepinephrine, and do-
pamine.Acommontheoryholdsthat
depressionandpainfulsymptomsfol-
low the same descending pathways
of the central nervous system. Eight
studies described the biological link
between depression and pain. Al-
though nociceptive fibers transmit-
ting pain signals from the periphery
of the body through the dorsal horn
to the medulla, midbrain, hypothala-
mus, thalamus, limbic cortical areas
(anterior cingulate and insular cor-
tex), somatosensory cortex, and pos-
terior parietal cortex have been care-
fully mapped, there is an increasing
interest in the neuroanatomy of a de-
scending system of pain modula-
tion.158 The increasing knowledge
about this system allows scientists
and physicians to better understand
mechanisms of pain modulation via
medications as well as psychologi-
cal mechanisms such as expecta-
tion, attention and distraction, and
negative and positive affect.

the Figure, the PAG is an anatomic
relay from limbic forebrain and mid-
brainstructurestothebrainstem.The
amygdala, hypothalamus, and fron-
tal neocortex all send fibers to the
PAG, which connects with relay sys-
tems in the pons and medulla.159
These relay systems contain seroton-
ergic neurons such as those in the
rostral-ventromedial medulla (RVM)

as those in the dorsolateral pontine

ing direct connections (inhibitory

has 2 types of cells important in pain
perception: “on cells,” which facili-

which inhibit pain perception.158
The on and off cells in the RVM

On the left is illustrated the transmission system for nociceptive messages. Noxious stimuli activate the
sensitive peripheral ending of the primary afferent nociceptor by the process of transduction (1). The
message is then transmitted over the peripheral nerve to the spinal cord, where it synapses with cells of
origin of the 2 major ascending pain pathways, the spinothalamic and spinoreticulothalamic. The
message is relayed in the thalamus to both the frontal cortex (F Cx) and the somatosensory cortex
(SS Cx). On the right is the pain modulation network. Inputs from the frontal cortex and hypothalamus
(Hyp) activate cells in the midbrain, which control spinal pain transmission cells via cells in the medulla.

rons or the DLPT neurons via
electrical stimulation depresses the
activity of nociceptive neurons in the
spinal dorsal horn.158,160 These bidi-
rectional on/off systems determine
vigilance to either external threats
or sensations coming from inside the
body.158,161 Limbic structures, the
PAG, and these on and off cells de-
termine affect and attention to pe-
ripheral stimuli. Normally, this sys-
tem has a modulatory effect, tending
to dampen signals coming in from
the body so that these signals are
suppressed, allowing attention to be
focused on more important events
outside of the body.159,161 However,
with depletion of serotonin and nor-
epinephrine, as occurs in depres-
sion, this system may lose its modu-
latory effect such that minor signals
from the body are amplified, and
more attention and emotion are fo-
cused on them. This explanation
may tell us why patients with de-
pression describe multiple pain
symptoms and why their pain is of-
ten associated with increased atten-
tion, focus, and negative affect.
Studies have shown that the
PAG and relay sites in the mid-
brain, medulla, amygdala, and dor-
sal horn are rich in endogenous opi-
oids such as enkephalins.158,162
Experimental studies have shown
that morphine applied at any of the
above sites of the descending pain
modulatory system (limbic cortex,
midbrain, medulla, or dorsal horn)
blocks peripheral pain signals.158,162
Serotonin and norepinephrine given
intrathecally also block pain sig-
nals.158,160 By increasing levels of
serotonin and norepinephrine avail-
ability in key brain areas, antide-
pressants also have effects on modu-
lating pain signals.163 This effect of
antidepressants may be greatest for
medications that increase availabil-
ity of serotonin and norepineph-
rine.163
Studies have shown that brain
regions involved in the generation
of emotion (eg, the medial prefron-
tal, insular, and anterior temporal
cortex, hypothalamus, and amyg-
dala) send many projections to
brainstem structures involved in
pain modulation (PAG and RVM).158
Studies have shown that the activ-
ity of the anterior cingulate gyrus in-
creases with peripheral pain stimuli,
such as heat applied to the skin, but
it also has increased activity when
warm stimuli are applied if the pa-
tient is expecting hot stimuli.158,164,165
Negative anticipation causes key
brain areas to activate, and the sub-
ject then appears to focus, attend to,
and rate the pain stimuli as more se-
vere. Distraction from pain signals
in experimental pain has been shown
in other experiments to decrease ac-
tivation of PAG and decrease pain
perception.164,165 Also, opiates ex-
cite off cells and inhibit on cells.
These 2 effects help suppress pain
signals. Perhaps these experiments
suggest how depression, which is as-
sociated with negative expectan-
cies, may amplify pain signals by ac-
tivating brain structures such as the
anterior cingulate gyrus. Depres-
sion is also associated with deple-
tion of serotonin and norepineph-
rine, which may decrease the
modulatory effect of this descend-
ing pain system.
CONCLUSIONS
Several key themes emerged from
our review of the relationship be-
tween depression and pain. First of
all, the prevalence of pain in a de-
pressed sample and the prevalence
of depression in a pain sample are
higher than the prevalence rates
when the conditions are individu-
ally examined. On average, 65% of
patients with depression experi-
ence one or more pain complaints,
and depression is present in 5% to
85% (depending on the study set-
ting) of patients with pain condi-
tions. Depression is most prevalent
in pain, psychiatric, and specialty
clinics vs population-based or pri-
mary care studies.
Second, the presence of pain
negatively affects the recognition and
treatment of depression. Depres-
sion is often underrecognized and
thusfrequentlyundertreated.Atleast
75% of primary care patients with
depression present with physical
complaints exclusively92,166 and sel-
dom attribute their pain symptoms
to depression or other psychiatric ill-
ness. These physical complaints may
be due to amplification of chronic
physical disease and remain medi-
cally unexplained after extensive
workup. As a result, providers fre-
quently assess for physical causes of
pain and treat medically instead of
exploring the pain symptoms in a
broader, biopsychosocial context.
Primary care providers should
recognize that pain is a common
symptom of depression, that depres-
sion and painful conditions fre-
quently coexist, and that evalua-
tion and treatment of both are
important. At least in primary care
settings, the typical depression pre-
sentation is complicated more of-
ten by painful symptoms and physi-
cal complaints than emotional
symptoms of sad mood or anhedo-
nia. The patient who presents “look-
ing depressed” is not difficult to rec-
ognize for most providers but may
represent the minority of patients
withdepressionseeninprimarycare.
Recognitionwouldlikelybeim-
proved by screening for depression
in any patient with unexplained pain
or unexplained exacerbation of a
stable painful condition. Often pa-
tients are referred to specialists with
expertise in treating pain or exper-
tiseintreatingdepressionratherthan
to a provider who is comfortable
treating both. Primary care physi-
cians seem to be in the best posi-
tion to manage both conditions but
may lack the knowledge and expe-
rience to tackle this difficult but
common clinical situation. Also, the
short visit times, inadequate reim-
bursement, and competing de-
mands on the primary care physi-
cian can interfere with optimal
management of these complex con-
ditions.167,168
Different aspects of pain nega-
tively affect several depression out-
comes. Increasing pain severity, pain
that interferes with daily activities,
frequent pain episodes, diffuse pain,
and pain that is refractory to treat-
ment are all associated with more de-
pressive symptoms and more se-
vere depression. Additionally, as
pain severity worsens, other depres-
sion outcomes such as functional
limitations, health-related quality of
life, and work function are ad-
versely affected. Pain with comor-
bid depression also appears to be ad-
ditive in terms of an increased
number of medical visits and higher
health care costs. The prognosis of
comorbid depression and pain is
poor compared with the prognosis

for individuals with depression with-
out pain.169 What is not clear is
whether patients with depression
and pain are less responsive to usual
depression management than those
with depression alone.
Our literature review estab-
lishes the reciprocal nature of the de-
pression-pain relationship. Depres-
sion complicates the management of
patients with pain and is associated
with poorer outcomes. In patients
with pain, depression is associated
with more pain complaints, greater
pain intensity, longer duration of
pain, and greater likelihood of non-
recovery. Additive impairments in
social function, work function, and
functional limitations (eg, limited
mobility and restricted activity) are
seen when depression and pain co-
exist. Depression also predicts in-
creased health care utilization,
poorer adherence to treatment,
worse patient satisfaction, and fu-
ture episodes of pain.
Most studies that examined an-
tidepressant treatment of pain con-
ditions suggested that pain and de-
pression symptoms improved
simultaneously, with the caveats that
most of these studies were uncon-
trolled, of short duration, and de-
signed more to measure pain re-
sponse. Tricyclic antidepressants
have been the predominant therapy
evaluated. Preliminary data sug-
gest that some of the newer antide-
pressants, including agents that act
on several receptors (eg, norepi-
nephrine and serotonin), may be
useful in chronic pain.170-173 How-
ever, larger clinical trials on non–
tricyclic antidepressants in pa-
tients with comorbid depression and
pain are needed. Unfortunately, very
few depression treatment trials have
assessed whether pain improves in
concert with depression symptoms
and whether greater improvement in
pain or depression relates to greater
improvement in the other condi-
tion. Despite the promising find-
ings that depression and pain re-
spond to antidepressant therapy,
many patients are treated primarily
with pain-relieving medications that
have little intrinsic antidepressant
effect.
Recent research has provided
evidence of a central pain modula-
tion system that can either dampen
or amplify nociceptive signals from
the periphery. Both serotonin and
norepinephrine have been shown to
dampen peripheral pain signals. This
explains how depression, which is
associated with a dysregulation of
these key modulating neurotrans-
mitters along a shared pathway, may
contribute to the frequent presence
of painful symptoms. Thus the de-
crease in one or both of these neu-
rotransmitters may increase periph-
eral pain messages and affect how
antidepressants that increase these
neurotransmitters decrease pain sig-
nals.
In summary, the combination
of depression and pain is associ-
ated with worse clinical outcomes
than either condition alone. Thus,
a treatment model that incorpo-
rates assessment and treatment of
both depression and pain seems nec-
essary for more optimal outcomes.
More research is needed to deter-
mine if alleviation of pain helps the
patients’ depressive symptoms and,
likewise, whether relief of depres-
sive symptoms improves pain and its
relatedmorbidity.Inattentiontopain
can cause refractoriness to depres-
sion treatment and not addressing
depression can preclude successful
pain treatment.Dual therapy trials
are needed to see if depression and
pain outcomes can be improved with
attention to their comorbidity.

Depression is perhaps the most frequent cause of emotional suffering in later life and significantly decreases
quality of life in older adults. In recent years, the literature on late-life depression has exploded. Many gaps in our
understanding of the outcome of late-life depression have been filled. Intriguing findings have emerged regarding
the etiology of late-onset depression. The number of studies documenting the evidence base for therapy has
increased dramatically. Here, I first address case definition, and then I review the current community- and clinic-
based epidemiological studies. Next I address the outcome of late-life depression, including morbidity and
mortality studies. Then I present the extant evidence regarding the etiology of depression in late life from
a biopsychosocial perspective. Finally, I present evidence for the current therapies prescribed for depressed
elders, ranging from medications to group therapy.
Depression . . . so mysteriously painful and elusive
. . . remains nearly incomprehensible to those
who have not experienced it in its extreme mood,
although the . . . ‘‘blues’’ which people go through
occasionally . . . are of such prevalence that they do
give many individuals a hint of the illness in its
catastrophic form.

EPRESSION is perhaps the most frequent cause of
emotional suffering in later life and signiﬁcantly
decreases quality of life in older adults (2–7). In recent
years, the literature on late-life depression has exploded.
Excellent North American epidemiological studies from the
1980s and early 1990s have been complemented by more
recent reports from other countries (2,4,8–12). Many gaps
in our understanding of the outcome of late-life depression
have been ﬁlled (13–15). Intriguing ﬁndings have emerged
regarding the etiology of late-onset depression (16–18). The
number of studies documenting the evidence base for
therapy has increased dramatically (19,20). In this review, I
ﬁrst address case deﬁnition, and then I review the current
community- and clinic-based epidemiological studies. Next
I address the outcome of late-life depression, including
morbidity and mortality studies. Then I present the extant
evidence regarding the etiology of depression in late life
from a biopsychosocial perspective (6,21). Finally, I present
evidence for the current therapies prescribed for depressed
elders, ranging from medications to group therapy. Given
the plethora of literature, important (though on my view not
critical) studies have necessarily been omitted, yet the cur-
rent review reﬂects the astounding advance of our database
since I reviewed the subject in 1989 (22).
CASE DEFINITION
Clinicians and clinical investigators do not agree as to
what constitutes clinically signiﬁcant depression, regard-
less of age, nor is there universal agreement about how
depression should be disaggregated into its component
subtypes. The subtypes most cogent to late-life depression
are reviewed in the paragraphs that follow. (Because of
space limitations, bereavement and bipolar disorder have
been omitted from this review.) There is considerable over-
lap across these subtypes, as the differentiations often re-
ﬂect particular orientations toward dissecting the syndrome,
that is, different ways of ‘‘slicing the pie.’’ When the factor
structure for the range of depressive symptoms is examined
across the life cycle, there are no major differences between
Caucasians and African Americans (23), between men and
women (4,23), or between older and younger adults (4,24).
Major depression is diagnosed in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), when the
older adult exhibits one or both of two core symptoms
(depressed mood and lack of interest) along with four or
more of the following symptoms for at least 2 weeks:
feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt; diminished
ability to concentrate or make decisions; fatigue; psycho-
motor agitation or retardation; insomnia or hypersomnia;
signiﬁcant decrease or increase in weight or appetite; and
recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation (25). The
symptoms of moderate to severe depression presented to
the clinician are similar across older adults and persons
in midlife if there are no comorbid conditions (26). How-
ever, there may be subtle differences by age. For example,
melancholia (symptoms of noninteractiveness and psycho-
motor retardation or agitation) appears to have a later age of
onset than nonmelancholic depression in clinical popula-
tions, with psychomotor disturbances being more distinct in
older persons (27,28).
Minor, subsyndromal, or subthreshold depression is
diagnosed according to the Appendix of DSM-IV when
one of the core symptoms just listed is present along with
one to three additional symptoms (25). Other operational
deﬁnitions of these less severe variants of depression
include a score of 161 on the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (29) but not meeting
criteria for major depression (10), a primarily biogenic
depression not meeting criteria for major depression yet
responding to antidepressant medication (30), or a score of
11–15 on the CES-D (31) and therefore not meeting the
CES-D criteria for clinically signiﬁcant depression, that is,

subthreshold depression. Minor depression variously de-
ﬁned has been associated with impairment similar to that of
major depression, including impaired physical functioning,
disability days, poorer self-rated health, use of psychotropic
medications, perceived low social support, female gender,
and being unmarried (10,31).
Other investigators have suggested a syndrome of
depression without sadness, thought to be more common
in older adults (32,33), or a depletion syndrome manifested
by withdrawal, apathy, and lack of vigor (34–36). Dys-
thymic disorder is a long-lasting chronic disturbance of
mood, less severe than major depression, that lasts for 2
years or longer (25). It rarely begins in late life but may
persist from midlife into late life (37,38). The aforemen-
tioned list is actually truncated from all the different
potential subtypes of depression that have been suggested,
both past and present. Modern psychiatry has been criticized
for its tendency to split syndromes into so many different
subtypes without adequate empirical (especially biological)
data to justify such splitting (39). One investigator has
suggested that the only meaningful split of the depressive
spectrum is a split between the more physical symptoms of
depression (such as anhedonia, agitation, and perhaps some
of the symptoms of executive dysfunction, see the paragraphs
that follow) and the more psychological symptoms (40).
Depression in late life is frequently comorbid with other
physical and psychiatric conditions, especially in the oldest
old (41). For example, depression is common in older pa-
tients recovering from myocardial infarction and other heart
conditions (41,42), and in those suffering from diabetes (43),
hip fracture (44), and stroke (45). In community-dwel-
ling Mexican American elders, depression was associated
with diabetes, arthritis, urinary incontinence, bowel incon-
tinence, kidney disease, and ulcers (a proﬁle different from
Caucasians, who exhibit comorbidities such as hip fracture
and stroke) (46). Major depression is generally thought to
be present in approximately 20% of Alzheimer’s patients
(47–49). In some studies, however, the rates are much lower
(1–5%) (50). Depressive symptoms may be common even in
elders with mild dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (51).
Some differences have been reported between early onset
(ﬁrst episode before the age of 60) and late onset (ﬁrst epi-
sode after the age of 60) depression. Personality abnormal-
ities, a family history of psychiatric illness, and dysfunctional
past marital relationships were signiﬁcantly more common in
early onset depression (52). However, when severity, pheno-
menology, history of previous episode, and neuropsycholog-
ical performance were compared, there were no differences
between early onset and late onset depression in elderly
people (52).
Interest in differentiating early- versus late-onset de-
pression in late life has arisen in large part because some
people have speculated that contributors to etiology may
vary by age of onset. For example, vascular depression
(depression proposed to be due to vascular lesions in the
brain)
may
be
much
more
common
with
late-onset
depression, and the clinical presentation may differ, even
if only in subtle ways (16,47,53). Severely depressed older
adults exhibit impairment in set shifting, verbal ﬂuency,
psychomotor speed, recognition memory, and planning
(executive cognitive function) (54). The clinical presentation
of elderly patients with this ‘‘depression–executive dysfunc-
tion syndrome’’ is characterized by psychomotor retardation
and reduced interest in activities but a less pronounced
vegetative syndrome than is seen in the depressed without
executive dysfunction. The dysfunction consists of impaired
verbal ﬂuency, impaired visual naming, and poor perfor-
mance on tasks of initiation and perseveration (55,56).
Vascular depression is associated with absence of psychotic
features, less likelihood of a family history, more anhedonia,
and greater functional disability when compared with
nonvascular depression (16,47,53,57).
Psychotic depression, when contrasted with nonpsychotic
depression, occurs in 20–45% of hospitalized elderly de-
pressed patients (58) and 3.6% of persons in the community
with depression (59). Recently a group of investigators
proposed a depression of Alzheimer’s disease. In persons
who meet criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (25),
three of a series of symptoms that includes depressed
mood, anhedonia, social isolation, poor appetite, poor sleep,
psychomotor changes, irritability, fatigue or loss of energy,
feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts must be
present for the diagnosis to be made (60).
EPIDEMIOLOGY oF LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION
Depressive symptoms are less frequent (or no more
frequent) in late life than in midlife (2,61,62), though some
suggest these estimates are biased secondary to ‘‘censoring’’
of population studies of older adults by means of increased
mortality among the depressed and difﬁculty in case ﬁnding
(63) (see Table 1). In a recent study, the lower frequency of
depressive symptoms in elderly people compared with people
in midlife was associated with fewer economic hardships
and fewer experiences of negative interpersonal exchanges
among both older disabled and nondisabled respondents. In
addition, religiosity among older disabled adults also ac-
counted for part of the lower frequency (64).
Reports of the prevalence of clinically signiﬁcant de-
pressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults
range from approximately 8% to 16% (2,4,9,62,65). Some
suggest that depression may be more frequent among Mexi-
can Americans than among non-Hispanic Caucasians and
African Americans. In one study, 25% of older Mexican
Americans scored 161 on the CES-D (66). In studies of
samples of mixed Caucasians and African Americans, rates
are similar (2,4). Nevertheless, African Americans are gener-
ally seen by psychiatrists to have fewer depressive symptoms
and are much less likely to be treated with antidepressant
medications (67,68).
Depressive symptoms are more frequent among the oldest
old, but the higher frequency is explained by factors asso-
ciated with aging, such as a higher proportion of women,
more physical disability, more cognitive impairment, and
lower socioeconomic status (41,69). When these factors are
controlled, there is no relationship between depressive symp-
tomsand age (2). The 1-year incidence of clinically signiﬁcant
depressive symptoms is high in the oldest old, reaching 13%
in those aged 85 years or older (70).
The prevalence estimates of major depression in com-
munity samples of elderly people have been quite low,

ranging from 1% to 4% overall, with higher prevalence
among women yet with no signiﬁcant racial or ethnic
differences (3,9,11,12). Estimates for dysthymia and minor
depression are somewhat higher, with the same pattern of
distribution across sex and race or ethnicity. In the North
Carolina Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study, in
which the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was used
(71), the prevalence estimate was 0.8% for major de-
pression, 2% for dysthymia, and 4% for minor depression
(3). Prevalence in the ECA studies overall in the elderly
population was 1.4% in women and 0.4% in men (8). The
prevalence of major depression in the Cache County, Utah,
study of community-dwelling elderly persons was 4.4% in
women and 2.7% in men (12). In Liverpool, investigators
estimated 2.9% of elders with major depression and 8.3%
with minor depression (72). In The Netherlands, inves-
tigators found 2.0% of older persons with major depression
and 12.9% with minor depression (10). In Sweden, preva-
lence of major depression in the community was higher
among the oldest old, from 5.6% at the age of 70 to 13% at
the age of 85 (73).
In the United States, the estimate of incidence (new cases
over a year) of major depression from the ECA overall
was 3 per 1000, with a peak in subjects in their ﬁfties (74).
The incidence of major depression in elderly people was
0.15%, similar to the rate in younger age groups (70,74,75).
In a study from Sweden, the incidence of major depression
was 12 per 1000 person-years in men and 30 per 1000
person-years in women between the ages of 70 and 85. The
incidence increased from 17 per 1000 person-years between
the ages of 70 and 79 to 44 per 1000 person-years between
79 and 85.
The prevalence estimates for major depression among
older adults hospitalized for medical and surgical services
is 10–12%, with an additional 23% experiencing signiﬁcant
depressive symptoms (76). Major depression affects 5–10%
of older adults who visit a primary care provider (77–79).
For example, in one study among 247 subjects in a primary
care setting, 9% were diagnosed with major depression,
6% with minor depression, and 10% with subsnydromal
depression. Fifty-seven percent of these depressed patients
experienced active depression at 1-year follow-up (77).
In one large study of a long-term care (LTC) facilility,
12.4% experienced major depression and 35% experienced
signiﬁcant depressive symptoms (80). In another study,
depression was found in 20% of patients admitted to a LTC
facility. Incidence of major depression at 1 year was 6.4%
(81). In another study of an LTC facility, prevalence of
major depressive disorder among testable subjects was 14.4%
(15% could not be tested) and prevalence of minor depres-
sion was 17%. Less than 50% of cases were recognized by
nursing and social work staff (82). Recognition and
treatment in LTC facilities for depression is consistently
poor across studies. For example, only 55% of depressed
patients in one LTC facility received antidepressant ther-
apy, and 32% of those received inadequate doses (83).
Screening LTC patients for depression, such as by using the
Geriatric Depression Scale (84), can increase the frequency
of treatment or referral by primary care physicians in
LTC (85).

able but ﬂuctuating course, and 33% tracked a severe
chronic course. In the subthreshold group, 25% experienced
a chronic course. Thirty-ﬁve percent of the major depres-
sives and 52% of the dysthymics experienced a chronic
course (13).
Major depression in older persons over longer follow-up
periods exhibits a chronic remitting course in most clinical
studies (86–91). In a 6-year follow-up of elderly depres-
sives, 31% recovered and remained well, 28% suffered
at least one relapse but recovered, 23% only partially re-
covered, and 17% remained depressed throughout the fol-
low-up (86). In another study, among a group of elderly
depressed patients (many of whom were medically ill) fol-
lowed for 1 year, 35% had good outcome, 48% had either
remittance and recurrence or remained continuously ill,
3% developed dementia, and 14% died (87). In a follow-up
of younger subjects who experienced early-onset severe
depression and survived into late life (follow-up for 25
years), only 12% remained continuously well in one study,
with neurotic and endogenous depression exhibiting similar
outcomes (92). These ﬁndings are similar to those in studies
of persons in young adulthood and midlife (93,94). Elderly
depressed outpatients without signiﬁcant comorbid medical
illness or dementia and who are treated optimally may exhi-
bit a much better outcome, with over 80% recovering and
remaining well throughout follow-up (90). In contrast, elders
with a lack of instrumental and social support and poor self-
rated health experience a longer time to remission (95).
The Impact of Medical Comorbidity,
Functional Impairment, and Cognitive Impairment
Medical comorbidity, functional impairment, and comor-
bid dementing disorders all adversely inﬂuence outcome
of depression. Depression, in turn, adversely affects the
outcome of the comorbid problems. Depression is a major
cause of weight loss in late life (96). Depression is fre-
quently associated with chronic medical illnesses such as
cardiovascular disease, and it can complicate the course
of these illnesses (97). In one study, older patients with
depression following a myocardial infarction were much
more likely to die in the ﬁrst 4 months after the event (26%
vs 7%) (98). Depression in late life was an independent risk
factor for heart failure among elderly women but not among
elderly men in another study (99,100). In another study,
depression was associated with a decrease in bone mineral
density in controlled analyses in people aged 65 years or
older (risk factors for osteoporosis) (101,102). Finally, late-
life depression has been found to be a risk for poor self-rated
health over time (103).
Few mechanisms for these associations have been
identiﬁed at present, yet some have been theorized and ex-
plored. Platelet activation is increased in elderly depressed
patients, especially those with the serotonin-transporter-
linked promotor region 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (this
group had signiﬁcantly higher platelet factor 4 and beta-
thromboglobulin levels). This ﬁnding suggests how some
depressed patients may be at greater biological risk for
morbidity and mortality with ischemic heart disease (104).
Poor appetite can lead to low body mass index associated
with late-life depression and subsequent frailty and failure
to thrive (41,105,106). In an 18-month prospective study of
community-dwelling older adults (including both spousal
caregivers of dementia patients and noncaregiving controls),
those with chronic, mild depressive symptoms had poorer
T-cell responses to two mitogens from baseline to follow-up.
In addition, among those with depression, older age was
associated with the poorest blastogenic response to mito-
gens at follow-up. The stress of caregiving may have aug-
mented this response. Older patients with depression have
higher levels of the cytokine interleukin 6, indicating in-
creased inﬂammatory activity, which may be linked to
increased bone resorption (or depressed patients may be
more sedentary, leading to increased resorption rates), thus
increasing the risk for hip fracture (107,108).
Depression is clearly associated with functional impair-
ment (2,109,110) and effects disability status over time
(55,111,112). In one study, depression increased the risk for
activities of daily living disability and mobility disability
over 6 years by 67% and 73%, respectively (113). Even
less severe symptoms of depression are associated with
functional decline, such as ‘‘depression without sadness’’
(32). Disability is also a risk factor for depression (114,115).
A number of explanations have been proposed. Physical
disability appears to lead to higher numbers of negative life
events. In addition, physical disability can lead to restriction
of valued social or leisure activities, isolation, and reduced
quality of social support (116). If disability can be im-
proved, then depression may be relieved. Yet another
explanation is that depression as a state is disabling. For
example, executive-type cognitive impairments caused by
depression may explain why depressed persons are more
disabled (55,117). When depression accompanies stroke,
functional outcome is compromised as well (118).
Functional decline is not inevitable following depression,
however. A diagnosis of depression in older primary care
patients in one study led to poorer self-reported role func-
tioning but not to poorer self-reported physical functioning
(119). Instrumental support provided to elders (such as help-
ing with tasks) was generally protective against worsening
performance on instrumental abilities of daily living among
elderly patients with recurrent unipolar depression. Subjec-
tive and structural dimensions of social support protected
the most severely depressed elderly patients against the loss
of basic maintenance abilities (a clinical sample) (120).
Severe depression with cognitive impairment, even when
the cognitive impairment remits, is a risk for Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) over 5 years (14). Early depressive symptoms
among subjects with minimal cognitive impairment (MCI)
may represent a preclinical sign and should be considered
a risk factor for impending AD or vascular dementia
(121). Depression further complicates the course of AD by
increasing disability and physical aggression and leading
to greater caregiver depression and burden (122–124).
However, in a follow-up study, depressive symptoms
among AD patients have higher rates of spontaneous res-
olution without requiring intensive drug treatment than
among vascular dementia patients, in whom depressive
symptoms are more persistent and refractory to drug
treatment (121).

Nonsuicide Mortality
Nonsuicide mortality is a signiﬁcant adverse outcome
resulting from late-life depression. In a review of 61 reports
from 1997 to 2001, 72% demonstrated a positive association
between depression and mortality in elderly people (15).
Another reviewer reported that, in 23 mortality studies of
depression (subjects 651 years of age), the pooled odds of
dying if subjects were depressed were 1.75. A longer follow-
up predicted smaller effect size. Both severity and duration
of depressive symptoms predict mortality in the elderly
population in these studies (125). Representative extant
studies include summary data from the ECA study, in which
the investigators found a fourfold increase in the odds of
dying over a follow-up of 15 months if persons 551 years of
age experienced a mood disorder (111). Other cross-national
studies of a positive association were found in Australia and
Japan (126,127). Among community-dwelling persons in
The Netherlands, both major and minor depression increased
the risk for cardiac mortality in subjects with and without
baseline cardiac disease (128). The association between de-
pression and mortality holds in many of these studies, des-
pite the addition of potentially confounding variables. For
example, in one study, high levels of depressive symptoms
independently predicted mortality in a study where demo-
graphics, medical comorbidity, smoking, and body mass
index were controlled (129). In studies from North Carolina
and New York, however, investigators failed to ﬁnd an
association (130,131). One reason for the lack of association
in some studies may be the selection of control variables
to be included, especially chronic disease and functional im-
pairment. For example, in a study of the North Carolina
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the
Elderly (EPESE) cohort, the unadjusted relative odds of
mortality among depressed subjects at baseline was 1.98.
These odds moved toward unity as other risk factors were
controlled, such as chronic disease, and health habits, cogni-
tive impairment, functional impairment, and social support
were added to the model (132). Therefore, the speciﬁc vari-
ables controlled in mortality studies may determine the
association between depression and mortality.
The effect of depression on mortality may vary by sex. In
elderly Japanese American men but not women, depressive
symptoms were a risk for mortality in the physically healthy
(133). In another study, depressive symptoms were a signif-
icant risk factor for cardiovascular but not cancer mortality
in older women (134,135). In a controversial report, investi-
gators found that subthreshold depression (CES-D scores
of 12–16) was not associated with mortality in men but
was negatively related to 3-year mortality in women (odds
ratio 5 .6) (136). In other words, mild depressive symptoms
were protective in this highly controlled analysis of com-
munity-based data.
Suicide
Suicide frequency in the 651 age group in the United
States was 16.9/100,000 per year in 1998 (137,138). The
frequency for white men increased with age, reaching 62/
100,000 in the 651 age range. Frequency among nonwhite
men was highest in young adulthood and was slightly higher
in midlife among women. The association of depression and
suicide has been well established in the literature across the
life cycle (138–143). Elderly persons attempting suicide are
also more likely to be widow(er)s, live alone, perceive their
health status to be poor, experience poor sleep quality, lack
a conﬁdant, and experience stressful life events, such as
ﬁnancial discord and interpersonal discord (138,143). The
most common means of committing suicide is the use of
voluntary drug ingestion. Whereas completed suicides in-
crease with age, suicidal behaviors do not increase (144).
There are approximately four attempts for each completed
suicide in late life compared with 10 or more attempts per
completed suicide earlier in life (145). Suicidal ideation is
high among older adults, ranging from 5% to 10% of the
population of older adults (138,140).
Health Services Utilization
Late-life depression leads to increased use of hospital and
outpatient medical services (146–148). For example, having
depressive symptoms was associated with a 19% increase in
the number of outpatient encounters and a 30% increase in
total outpatient charges in a Minnesota health maintenance
organization. Taking antidepressant medications was asso-
ciated with a 32% increase in total outpatient charges but
was not signiﬁcantly associated with number of outpatient
encounters. Depressive symptoms and antidepressant ther-
apy were not signiﬁcantly associated with inpatient utiliza-
tion or charges (149). Older persons are quite likely to use
antidepressant medications, most of which are prescribed for
depression (68). In a community sample in North Carolina,
14.3% of Caucasians and 5% of African Americans used
antidepressants in 1996 (in controlled analyses, Caucasians
were 3.8 times more likely to use antidepressants than
African Americans).
ETIOLOGY
Biological
Any discussion of the biological etiology of depression
must begin with medical illness, for depression among
the medically ill in late life is almost ubiquitous, as just
documented. In addition to the association of depression
with dementing disorders, cardiovascular disease, and hip
fractures, among patients with Parkinson’s disease, 20%
meet criteria for major depression and 21% meet it for minor
depression (150). Depression has been associated with pain
in institutionalized elderly people (151) and is also common
among homebound elders with urinary incontinence (152).
Both alcohol dependence and major depression pose
signiﬁcant risk for the development of the other disorder
at 1-year follow-up (153). In a series of recently reported
studies, diastolic hypotension was associated with low posi-
tive affect, whereas systolic hypertension was associated
with a positive affect. Use of antihypertensive medication
was independently associated with lower positive affect in
elderly people (154). Male veterans who were hospitalized
during World War II for head injury were more likely to
report major depression in subsequent years (155).
Great interest has arisen in recent years to search for
genetic susceptibility to mood disorders across the life cycle
(156). In a community sample of elderly twins, genetic
253

inﬂuences accounted for 16% of the variance in total
depression scores on the CES-D and 19% of psychosomatic
and somatic complaints. In contrast, genetics contributed
a minimal amount to the variance in reports of depressed
mood and psychological well-being (157). Yet the likeli-
hood of identifying a family history of mood disorder in
a clinically depressed older adult is lower than for persons in
midlife. In a clinical study, the risk for immediate relatives
of patients with depression whose onset occurred after age
50 was 8.3% compared with 20.1% for relatives of patients
whose onset occurred at a younger age (158).
Attention has been directed to speciﬁc genetic markers for
late-life depression. Given the great interest in the e4 allele
of the apolipoprotein E gene, a number of studies have
focused on this susceptibility gene for Alzheimer’s disease.
No association was found in a community sample between
e4 and depression (159). In another study, hyperintensities
in deep white matter but not in the periventricular white
matter were associated with depressive symptoms, espe-
cially in elders carrying the e4 allele (160). Other investi-
gators have concentrated on genes possibly associated with
vascular lesions in the central nervous system. In one study,
patients with late onset depression had an increased rate of
the C677T mutation of the MTHFR (methylene tetrahydro-
folate reductase) enzyme. This mutation may place older
persons at risk for vascular depression (57). CADASIL
(cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is a disease of the notch
3 gene. Depression is one of the initial symptoms in this
condition, suggesting that genetic polymorphisms or muta-
tions may predispose older adults to vascular depression.
This genotype, however, is rare (161,162).
Much attention has been directed to vascular risk for late-
life depression, and this attention dates back at least 40
years, although the advent of magnetic resonance imaging
boosted interest considerably (86,163–166). Recent studies
suggest that vascular lesions in selected regions of the brain
may contribute to a unique variety of late-life depression—
hence the interest in vascular depression as just discussed.
The vascular depression impairments resemble impairments
exhibited in frontal lobe syndromes. Magnetic resonance
imaging of depressed patients has revealed structural ab-
normalities in areas related to the cortical–striatal–pallidal–
thalamus–cortical pathway (167), including the frontal lobes
(168), caudate (169), and putamen (170). These circuits are
strongly implicated in the development of spontaneous per-
formance strategies demanded by executive tasks. Recent
interest has also focused on a smaller size of the orbital
frontal cortex in late-life depression (171). In addition, left
hippocampal volume has been found to be smaller in de-
pressed elders who develop dementia over time (172). The
frontal white matter (not gray matter) lesions in late-life
depression are associated with increased myoinositol–creati-
nine and choline–creatinine ratios. These changes may re-
ﬂect biological changes in nonneural (glial) tissue, which in
turn affects synaptic activity (166).
Serotonin activity, speciﬁcally, 5 HT2A receptor binding,
decreases dramatically in a variety of brain regions through
midlife, but there is less decrease from midlife to late life.
These 5 HT2A receptors in normal healthy subjects de-
creased markedly from young adulthood to midlife (70%
from the levels at age 20 through the ﬁfth decade), and then
leveled off as age advanced. Receptor loss occurred across
widely scattered regions of the brain (anterior cingulated,
occipital cortex, and hippocampus) (18). The relationship of
serotonin depletion can also be studied indirectly by the
study of radioisotope-labeled or tritiated imipramine binding
(TIB) sites. There is a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of
platelet-TIB sites in elderly depressed patients, compared
with
elderly
controls
and
individuals
suffering
from
Alzheimer’s disease (173).
In aged monkeys (Macaca mulatta), signiﬁcant age-
related decreases in 5 HT1A receptor binding were observed
only in the frontal and temporal cortices. In the hippo-
campus, although 5 HT1A receptor binding indicated
nonsigniﬁcant age-related changes, the degree of displace-
ment when binding to a receptor agonist was decreased in
the aged monkeys. This ﬁnding suggests that age-related
impairment of 5 HT1A receptor response might be related to
the reduced efﬁcacy of antidepressant therapy in elderly
patients with depression (174).
Endocrine changes have also been associated with late-
life depression. Although the dexamethasone suppression
test was long ago ruled out as a diagnostic test for depres-
sion, nonsuppression of cortisol is associated with late-life
depression compared with age-matched controls (175). De-
pression is associated with hypersecretion of corticotropin-
releasing factor (CRF), which is thought to mediate sleep
and appetite disturbances, reduced libido, and psychomotor
changes (176). Aging is associated with an increased respon-
siveness of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol,
and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) to CRF (177).
Low levels of DHEA have been associated with higher rates
of depression and a greater number of depressive symptoms
in community-dwelling older women (178). Total testoster-
one levels were lower in elderly men with dysthymic
disorder than in men with major depressive disorder and
men without depressive symptoms in another study (179).
However, the efﬁcacy of testosterone in treating depression
has not been established (180). Depression has also been
associated with postprandial systolic hypotension (181).
Hormone replacement in women has been associated with
improvements in mood (182).
Psychological
Behavioral, psychodynamic, and cognitive aberrations
have all been suggested as causes of late-life depression.
Three examples will illustrate these proposed etiologies. The
behavior of learned helplessness, originally used to de-
scribed the increasingly passive behavior of dogs produced
by inescapable shock, has been expanded to explain de-
pressive symptoms across the life cycle, suggesting that
the cause of depression is the expectation that initiating
action in a continually stressful environment is futile (6,183,
184). The association of depression with severe or frequent
adverse life events could be interpreted in part as a behavi-
oral response to continued adverse stressors. Depression in
old age has been associated with emotional abuse and
neglect during childhood, as well as relational stress and
problem behavior of signiﬁcant others during late adulthood
254

(especially high when many events reported during adult-
hood and late adulthood) (185). In a meta-analysis, the
number of total negative life events and daily hassles was
associated with depression in elderly people (186). Severe
events show the largest relative risk, but ongoing difﬁculties
account for the most episodes. The association of severe
events with onset tends to be stronger in ﬁrst than in recur-
rent episodes. Mild events can trigger a recurrence but not a
ﬁrst episode, suggesting that once the development of the
behavior of ‘‘depression’’ follows a stressor, the triggers for
subsequent episodes of depression need not be severe there-
after (187).
According to one psychodynamic theory, the search for
restitution secondary to the inevitable losses in late life is
a major developmental task for aging individuals and
a depression-like syndrome may appear, a ‘‘depletion syn-
drome,’’ when this task is not accomplished successfully.
If one lives long enough, the inevitable object loss, body
change, and disease lead to a state of both internal and ex-
ternal depletion (6,188). A more recent yet controversial
theory complements the depletion theory, suggesting that
successful aging is associated with ‘‘selective optimization
with compensation’’ (189). This model is based on a recog-
nition by the elder of the realities of aging, especially the
losses. Such recognition leads to selection of realistic acti-
vities, optimization of those activities, and compensation for
lost activities, which in turn leads to a reduced and trans-
formed life.
Perhaps the most dominant psychological model of
depression is the model of cognitive distortions (190). In
a case-control study, patients with major depression per-
ceived greater negative impact of life events than patients
with dysthymicdisorder and healthy controls (191). The inter-
pretation of life events is the key to understanding depres-
sion under this theory. Cognitions may be distorted such that
the elder has unrealistic expectations, overgeneralizes certain
adverse events, overreacts to events, and personalizes events.
Perceived negative interpersonal events are associated with
depression in elders, particularly in those who demonstrate a
high need for approval and reassurance in the context of inter-
personal relationships. In contrast, negative achievement
events are associated with depression in those who placed
a heavy emphasis on personal success and control. This con-
ceptualization is consistent with the diathesis-stress model,
namely that negative experience best predicts depression
when a speciﬁc type of event affects a personal vulnerability
(192,193).
Social
The association between late-life depression and impaired
social support has been established for many years. In
a community study in Hong Kong (194), impaired social
support and depression were associated (including network
size, network composition, social contact frequency, satis-
faction of social support, and instrumental–emotional sup-
port). Impaired social support is associated with poorer
outcome of depression in older men but not older women
(195). In female caregivers of demented elderly people, the
prevalence rate of depressive disorders reaches 45–47%, and
these women are twice as likely to use psychotropic drugs
(196,197). Loneliness may be a key factor in depression
among caregivers (198). Some have attempted to couple the
theory of social disengagement with aging (much debated in
the literature) with depression, suggesting that some symp-
toms of depression, such as lack of social interest and greater
self-involvement, mirror attributes of older adults according
to Disengagement Theory (199,200). Other factors being
equal, it is probable that elders who are less socially engaged
are more depressed. For example, elders who stopped driving
had a greater risk of worsening depressive symptoms (201).
Spiritual and Existential
Religious practice is associated with less depression in
elderly Europeans (EURODEP), both on the individual and
the national level. This is especially true when religious
practice is embedded within a traditional value orientation
(202). Some investigators have proposed that ‘‘religious
coping’’ (subjects perceiving that religion is the most
important factor in coping) is associated with improved
emotional and physical health (203,204). They found that
religious coping was associated with a decrease in certain
types of depressive symptoms, including loss of interest,
feelings of worthlessness, withdrawal from social inter-
actions, loss of hope, and other cognitive symptoms of depres-
sion. Religious coping was not associated with a reduction
in somatic symptoms.
DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
Much of the diagnostic workup of late-life depression
derives from what we know about symptom presentation
and etiology (see Table 2). Basically, the diagnosis is made
on the basis of a history augmented with a physical and ﬁne-
tuned by laboratory studies. There is no biological marker
or test that makes the diagnosis, though for some subtypes
of depression, such as vascular depression, the presence
of subcortical white matter hyperintensities on magnetic
resonance imaging scanning are critical to the diagnosis
(6,185).
Screening is beneﬁcial when standardized screening scales
such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or the CES-D
are used (29,84,205). Screening in primary care is critical.
Not only is the frequency of depression high, but suicidal
ideation is high as well. The prevalence of serious suicidal
ideation in one primary care setting was 1% and the prev-
alence approaches 5% among older adults who report sig-
niﬁcant symptoms of depression (206,207). However, the
documented success of screening has been mixed in extant
studies. Internists tend to accept responsibility for treating
late-life depression but perceive their clinical skills as
inadequate and are frustrated with their practice environ-
ment (207). Nearly all studies of treatment efﬁcacy with
pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy focus on older adults
with uncomplicated major depression, which may apply to
less than 15% of the depressed people in primary care (208).
Primary care physicians were informed of patient-speciﬁc
treatment recommendations for depressed patients 601 years
of age in one controlled study. The patients of physicians
in the intervention group were more likely to be diagnosed
with depression and prescribed antidepressant medications,

though the outcome of the depression was no better for the
intervention group than for the control group (209).
Cognitive status should be assessed with the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE), given the high likelihood
of comorbid depression and cognitive dysfunction (210).
Nutritional status is most important to evaluate in the de-
pressed elder, including height, weight, history of recent
weight loss, lab tests for hypoalbuminemia, and cholesterol,
given the risk for frailty and failure to thrive in depressed
elders, especially the oldest old (41,106). General health
perceptions (211) as well as functional status (activities of
daily living) should be assessed for all depressed elderly
patients (212,213). Other factors critical to assess in the
diagnostic workup include social functioning (214), medi-
cations (many prescribed drugs can precipitate symptoms
of depression), mobility and balance, sitting and standing
blood pressure, blood screen, urinalysis, chemical screen
(e.g., electrolytes, which may signal dehydration) and an
electrocardiogram if cardiac disease is present (especially
if antidepressant medications are indicated) (41).
TREATMENT
Biological
Antidepressant medications have become the foundation
for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in older
adults. Virtually all antidepressant medications are equally
effective for treating serious major depression across the life
cycle (19,215,216). Studies that compare tricyclic antide-
pressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) usually ﬁnd equal efﬁcacy, yet there are fewer side
effects with SSRIs (217). Therefore, SSRIs are the treatment
of choice (203,206). The antidepressants even appear to
be efﬁcacious in subjects with subcortical hyperintensities
(vascular depression) (218,219). Although subjects with de-
pression and smaller frontotemporal volumes on magnetic
resonance imaging were more treatment resistant in one
study (220), a number of studies document the efﬁcacy of
antidepressant therapy for treating depression in dementia
(221–223).
Antidepressants appear less efﬁcacious in treating less
severe depression (224). A large study in a primary care
setting found that paroxetine showed moderate beneﬁts
for depressive symptoms and mental health functioning in
elderly patients with dysthymia and more severely impaired
elderly patients with minor depression (compared with
problem-solving therapy) (225). The overall evidence sug-
gests that antidepressants and counseling have relatively
small beneﬁt in these less severe conditions (226). The use of
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) has been rec-
ommended for less severe depression and, given that it is
available over the counter, it is used by mildly depressed older
adults (and perhaps some who are more severely depressed).
A recent study did not ﬁnd that St. John’s wort was as
effective as sertraline in moderately severe major depression
(mostly persons in midlife) (227). Nevertheless, this study
has been criticized for not focusing on the mildly depressed.
Most of the SSRIs have been demonstrated to be ef-
ﬁcacious in elderly people, including the drugs ﬂuoxetine
(228), sertraline (229), paroxetine (217,230), citalopram
(231),
and
ﬂuvoxamine
(232).
(Escitalipram,
recently
entering the antidepressant market, has not been shown to
be speciﬁcally efﬁcacious in the elderly population.) Other
new-generation antidepressants that have been shown to
be efﬁcacious include venlafaxine (233), mirtazapine (234,
235), nefazodone (in a general study of depression), and
buproprion (236,237). Nefazodone (238) has not been shown
to be speciﬁcally efﬁcacious in elderly people, because to date
there has been no study of the drug in the elderly population.
In a recent consensus of practicing geriatric psychiatrists,
the SSRIs along with psychotherapy are the treatments of
choice for late-life depression, along with venlafaxine XR.
Buproprion and mirtazapine are alternates (as was electro-
convulsive therapy, or ECT, in severe depression). Medi-
cation (SSRI plus an antipsychotic, with risperidone and
olanzapine being the antipsychotics most commonly rec-
ommended) and (or) ECT are the preferred treatments of
unipolar psychotic major depression. Medications plus
psychotherapy are recommended for dysthymic disorder.
Education plus watchful waiting are recommended for
minor depression that lasts for less than 2 weeks (anti-
depressant medication plus psychotherapy are recommended
for minor depression if symptoms persist). The preferred anti-
depressant for treating both major and minor depression is
citalopram (20–30 mg) followed by sertraline (50–100 mg)
and paroxetine (20–30 mg), with ﬂuoxetine (20 mg) as an
alternate. Nortriptyline (40–100 mg) is the preferred tricyclic
agent, with desipramine (50–100 mg) as the alternate. The
consensus recommendation is to continue an antidepressant
3–6 weeks before a change in medications is made. If little
or no response is observed, the consensus is to switch to
venlafaxine (75–200 mg). For a ﬁrst episode of depression
with recovery following antidepressant therapy, 1 year of
continual therapy is recommended. For two episodes, 21
years of continual therapy and for three or more episodes,

31 years of continual therapy are recommended (239), as
shown in Table 3.
Many factors may alter the efﬁcacy or the side effects of
the antidepressant drugs in late life. For example, estrogen
therapy and DHEA have been demonstrated to augment
sertraline treatment (240,241). A number of the cytochrome
P450 enzymes that metabolize most medications are inhib-
ited by antidepressants, such as CYP3A, CYP2D6, DYP2C,
CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. The CYP3A enzymes metabolize
60% of the medications used today. Fluoxetine is a moderate
inhibitor of CYP3A4. Approximately 8–10% of adults lack
the CYP2dD6 enzyme, and paroxetine is a potent inhibitor
of this enzyme (which may explain, among some patients
treated with paroxetine, the lack of efﬁcacy of analgesics
such as codeine that are metabolized by this enzyme). Cita-
lopram and venlafaxine are the ‘‘cleanest’’ of the medications
in terms of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes
(242,243).
Elderly inpatients on SSRIs or venlafaxine are at deﬁnite
risk for developing hyponatremia (39% in one study) and
should have sodium levels checked before and after com-
mencement of antidepressant medications (244). This hypo-
natremia is due to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone. Other serious side effects reported with
the SSRIs include the risk of falls (no less risk than with
the tricyclics in one study) (245), the serotonin syndrome
(lethargy, restlessness, hypertonicity, rhabdomyolysis, renal
failure, and possible death) (246), and gastrointestinal
bleeding (247). Less serious side effects include weight loss,
sexual dysfunction, anticholinergic effects (most pronounced
with paroxetine), agitation, and difﬁculty sleeping.
Subjects with psychotic depression respond poorly to
antidepressants but well to ECT (248). Many studies have
documented the effectiveness of ECT in older adults (249–
251). Some investigators report the response as good in
elderly as in young people (252), whereas others suggest
that the response is less optimal in the oldest old (253).
In one study using bilateral ECT versus pharmacotherapy,
the 651 age group had a better response to ECT than
younger age groups (254). Memory problems remain the
major adverse effect from ECT that affects quality of life.
Memory problems are usually transient and clear within
weeks following treatment. A relatively new procedure that
could replace ECT in some situations is repetitive trans-
cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (255). TMS does not
require anesthesia and seizure induction is avoided. Though
not studied speciﬁcally in elderly people, in one outcome
study, patients treated with rTMS compared with ECT
responded equally well and their clinical gains lasted at least
as long as those with ECT (256). In another study, executive
function improved in both middle-aged and elderly de-
pressed subjects with rTMS compared with sham treatments
(257).
Investigators with the Alameda County Study explored
the association of exercise and depression, controlling for
functional status. Among subjects who were not depressed
at baseline, those who reported a low activity level were at
signiﬁcantly greater risk for depression at follow-up (258).
On the basis of controlled trials, an aerobic exercise training
program may be considered an alternative to antidepressants
for treatment of depression in older persons (259). However,
the advantages of exercise are not limited to aerobic activi-
ties. Unsupervised weight lifting has been found to decrease
depressive symptoms up to 20 weeks after induction (260).
Light therapy may also be beneﬁcial, especially if the de-
pression follows a seasonal pattern. Thirty minutes of bright
light a day improved depression among institutionalized
elders in one controlled study (261).
Psychological
Psychotherapy has received much attention and study as
a treatment modality for depressed older adults over the
past 20 years. This attention results from the development
of ‘‘manualized’’ therapies, such as cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). These
therapies can be taught clearly and easily to Masters-level
clinicians and can be monitored for accuracy in following the
procedures of the therapy. Most of these therapies are short
term (12–20 sessions) and therefore much more attractive to
third-party payers. In addition, the educational (as opposed
to a reﬂective) posture of the therapist employing manualized
therapies is attractive to elders. In one study comparing range
of referrals, outcomes, attendance rates, and length of time in
therapy between older and younger adults participating
in cognitive therapy, there was no signiﬁcant differences
in therapy outcome apart from home adjustment measures
where older adults showed greater improvement. Younger
adults showed signiﬁcantly higher rates of nonattendance
and had higher dropout rates (262).
Nevertheless, psychotherapy remains an infrequently
prescribed therapy for depressed older adults. In a study
of general internists, only 27% said they would refer a
depressed older adult for psychotherapy (263). In a sample
of primary care elderly patients in Quebec, the acceptability
of a therapy was dependent on the severity of symptoms.
CBT and cognitive bibliotherapy were rated more accept-
able than antidepressants when the symptoms were less
severe. Antidepressants were more acceptable than either
CBT or bibliotherapy when the patient’s symptoms were
severe (264).
CBT and IPT have been the most frequently studied of
the manualized therapies (20,262–266). Exact mechanisms

that render CBT and IPT effective, however, remain un-
clear (267). CBT focuses on thoughts that may perpetuate
depression. The therapeutic goal of the therapist is to teach
the patient to change these thought patterns or adapt to
them. By changing thoughts, people change dysfunctional
attitudes as well, and these attitudes are hypothesized to pre-
cipitate and perpetuate depressive thoughts (192). Studies
increasingly suggest that the more central mechanism for
changing thought patterns is the development of metacog-
nition, that is, ‘‘stepping back’’ and responding to negative
thoughts as transitory events rather than as inherent aspects
of the self (268). In one study comparing CBT and brief
psychodynamic therapy to a wait-list control group, all of
the treatment modalities led to a comparable and clinically
signiﬁcant reduction of depression (265). Twelve months
after the treatment, 58% of the sample population was de-
pression free, and at 24 months, 70% was depression free.
In another study, older depressed patients were assigned to
CBT alone, medication alone, or a combination of medica-
tion and CBT (269). Although all groups showed improve-
ment, the combined group showed the greatest improvement.
IPT is a manualized treatment that focuses on four
components hypothesized to lead to or maintain depression:
grief (e.g., death of a loved one); interpersonal disputes
(e.g., conﬂict with adult children); role transitions (e.g.,
retirement); and interpersonal deﬁcits (e.g., lack of asser-
tiveness skills). The treatment has been adapted speciﬁcally
for older adults (270,271). In combination with nortripty-
line, IPT has been shown to be an effective treatment for
elderly depressed subjects (90,272,273). In one study, investi-
gators achieved an excellent initial response (74%) with
only 15% recurrence at the end of 1 year (90). Subjects who
respond do not tend to relapse over fairly extensive periods
(272).
More reﬂective therapies include psychodynamic therapy,
life review therapy, and reminiscence therapy. Cases of
successful psychodynamic therapy have been presented in
the literature among older adults (274), and in one study
psychodynamic therapy was as effective as CBT (275).
Given its very nature, however, psychodynamic psycho-
therapy is most difﬁcult to investigate empirically. In life
review therapy, subjects are encouraged to acknowledge
past conﬂicts and consider their meaning. In reminiscence
therapy, the focus is more on positive memories in group
settings. Both structured and unstructured reminiscence
therapy lead to improvement compared with controls, and
the structured group did even better (276). In contrast,
another study found no improvement over wait-list controls
(277). Bibliotherapy emphasizes a skills acquisition ap-
proach through select readings from books. For example,
subjects may read Feeling Good (278), a self-help book
that emphasizes employing cognitive skills to overcome
depression. In a series of controlled randomized studies for
mild to moderate depression in older adults, bibliotherapy
was shown to be efﬁcacious (279–282). Bibliotherapy has
advantages for older adults. Elders can read and process the
material at their own pace. Fears of stigmatization can be
avoided and, for elders with impaired activities of daily
living, this intervention does not require as many visits to
a therapist (267).
Group therapy is used frequently with older adults,
though it is less often studied compared with individual ther-
apy (283). Self-management therapy and education groups
were equally effective and superior to wait-list controls in
one study (284). CBT and psychodynamic group therapy
were more effective than placebo but less effective than
tricyclics in other studies (285,286). In a recent study, in-
vestigators found that antidepressant medication plus clinical
management, either alone or with addition of group-
administered dialectical behavior therapy (skills training
and scheduled coaching sessions), found that the medica-
tion–dialectical behavior therapy groups had a higher
continued remission rate than medications alone (267,287).
Combined Medication and Psychotherapy
In geriatric patients with recurrent major depression,
maintenance treatment with nortriptyline or IPT is superior
to placebo in preventing or delaying recurrence. Combined
treatment using both appears to be the optimal clinical
strategy in preserving recovery (272). Combined treatment
with nortriptyline and IPT is also more likely to maintain
social adjustment (performance–impaired or not, interper-
sonal behavior–hypersensitivity, friction–quarreling, satis-
faction–loneliness) than treatment with either alone (288).
The PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care
Elderly-Collaborative Trial) is testing whether a trained clin-
ician (a ‘‘health specialist’’) can work in close collaboration
with a primary care physician to implement a comprehen-
sive depressive management program including pharmaco-
therapy and IPT. The goal is to reduce suicidal ideation
(289). Older patients with suicidal ideation in the midst of
a recurrent episode of major depression respond as well as
nonsuicidal patients, yet those with ideation have higher
relapse rates during continuation treatment and were more
likely to receive augmentation pharmacotherapy (290).
CAN LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION BE PREVENTED?
The extant psychiatric literature suggests virtually no
empirical evidence of psychosocial primary prevention. A
MEDLINE review of the American Journal of Psychiatry
from 1990 to 2001 and the American Journal of Geriatric
Psychiatry from 1997 to 2001 did not yield a single empirical
study of the primary prevention of depression in the elderly
population (or of an intervention strategy that might be con-
sidered universal) (291). The few references to primary pre-
vention of late-life depression focused on blood pressure
control to prevent cerebrovascular disease as a means of pre-
venting vascular depression (292). In contrast, these journals
are replete with articles regarding secondary prevention, that
is, the early treatment of depression with medications and
psychotherapy to remit depression and prevent its serious
consequences as already described (19,272). As already de-
scribed regarding the PROSPECT study, tertiary prevention
(preventionoftheseriousconsequencesoflate-lifedepression
such as suicide) has received attention as well. The biological
emphasis of today’s psychiatry coupled with the paucity of
empirical studies that document the beneﬁt of primary (or
universal) prevention undoubtedly have inﬂuenced recent
contributions to the literature.

A recent study among elderly people is directly relevant
to primary prevention (293). Elderly subjects who experi-
enced chronic illness were randomly assigned to a classroom
intervention, a home study program, and a wait list. Both
interventions provided instruction on mind–body relation-
ships, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, problem
solving, communication, behavioral treatment for insomnia,
nutrition, and exercise (a multimodal intervention strategy
that integrates many approaches to enhancing self-efﬁcacy
in elderly people). The home version was delivered by class
videotapes and readings. Compared with the control con-
dition, both interventions led to signiﬁcant decreases in
self-reports of pain, sleep difﬁculties, and symptoms of
depression and anxiety. Such nonpharmacological inter-
ventions among vulnerable older adults may become
increasingly important in our efforts to decrease the burden
of depression among older adults.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In a recent editorial derived from a conference devoted
to the diagnosis and treatment of late-life depression, the
authors concluded, ‘‘Treatment works, but mood disorders
in old age remain a big public health issue. Disability, de-
cline, diminished quality of life, demands on care givers and
discriminatory reimbursement policies [persist] . . . partner-
ships among researchers, clinicians, governmental agencies,
third payers, patients and family members will be essential
to further progress in the next 10 years’’ (294, p. 146). No
one can reasonably argue with this conclusion. I would add
that perhaps some slight paradigm shifts may be called for
as well. For example, we must consider more carefully the
boundaries between ‘‘true’’ clinical depression and less se-
vere (perhaps adaptive) depressive symptoms among elders.
In addition, the efﬁcacy of antidepressants (which are now
used widely) has been amply demonstrated in clinical trials,
yet we have not veriﬁed the effectiveness of these medi-
cations in reducing the burden of depressive symptoms
among the populace of older adults and in decreasing the
frequency of suicide. Effectiveness studies are critical lest
we falsely equate use of medications with adequate treat-
mentofdepressedelders.Finally,thelivesofolderadultsinthe
United States over the past 20 years have been more healthy,
happy, and economically viable than at any time during the
twentieth century. Unfortunately, current government poli-
cies, especially the erosion of retirement plans, increasingly
evasive universal health care, and the erosion of more
meaningful and long-lasting social ties (295) may place older
adults at much greater vulnerability over the next 20 years.

Major depressive disorder is a common problem
for adolescents. It has a wide array of symptoms
affecting somatic, cognitive, affective, and social
processes. Academic failure, poor peer relationships,
behavioral problems, conflict with parents and other
authority figures, and substance abuse are some of
the consequences of major depressive disorder in this
age group. Effective treatments include nontricyclic
antidepressants and coping skills training. The nurse is
key to depression detection and suicide prevention,
especially in primary care settings. Through psy-
choeducation, nurses can promote recovery from
depression by encouraging a healthy lifestyle, enhanc-
ing social skills, and assisting the adolescent to identi-

Major depressive disorder (MDD) often compli-
cates the tumultuous adolescent years. The physio-
logical, psychological, and social changes that char-
acterize adolescence increase the risk for MDD and
other related depressive disorders. In turn, MDD can
promote adolescent risk behaviors, including sub-
stance abuse. The impulsivity of adolescence com-
bined with MDD also can lead to death by suicide.
MDD in adolescents can be treated successfully
when recognized and treated according to practice
guidelines. In this article, MDD in adolescents and
young adults ages 15 to 24 years is described,
including its incidence and appearance in different
ethnic groups, potential outcomes with untreated
MDD, and assessment and treatment.
The Depressive Disorders
The depressive disorders include MDD, dys-
thymia, and bipolar disorder. MDD is the most com-
mon depressive disorder in adolescents, and in this
article, depression refers to this form of depressive
disorder. MDD is present when either depressed
mood or a lack of pleasure in usual activities is pres-
ent continuously for 2 weeks or more and is accom-
panied by five or more additional symptoms (Amer-
ican 
Psychiatric 
Association 
[APA], 
2000).
Symptoms include changes in appetite, sleep, or
weight; fatigue; decreased libido; difficulty concen-
trating; feelings of worthlessness; and, in moderate
to severe cases of MDD, recurrent thoughts of
death. There is a strong genetic component in MDD,
with the highest rates seen in first-degree relatives.
The point prevalence for MDD in adolescents ranges
from 0.4% to 8.3% and the lifetime prevalence is
approximately 10% to 28% (Birmaher et al., 1996b;
Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seely, 1998a). Girls are twice
as likely as boys to have MDD.
Dysthymic disorder (DD) also is seen in adoles-
cents and is present when depressed mood or irri-
tability is present every day for at least 1 year. It is
accompanied by the same symptoms seen in MDD
and feelings of hopelessness and low self-esteem, but
it does not meet the full criteria for MDD. Adoles-
cents with DD are at high risk of developing MDD,
and when this occurs, it is referred to as double
depression (Cicchetti & Toth, 1998).
Approximately 10% to 15% of adolescents with
recurrent MDD will subsequently develop bipolar
disorder (APA, 2000). In bipolar disorder, both
mania and MDD are part of the illness spectrum.
Mania is characterized by an expansive or irritable
mood accompanied by an inflated self-esteem,
decreased need for sleep, extreme talkativeness, and
flight of ideas. In adolescents, school failure and truancy,
antisocial behavior, and substance abuse may be present
(APA, 2000). Typically, a manic episode immediately pre-
cedes or follows the depressive phase of the illness.
Adolescent Development 
and the Risk of MDD
The physical, psychological, and social changes of ado-
lescence make this life transition a high-risk period for the
development of MDD (Cicchetti & Toth, 1998). In an
analysis of gender differences in the development of
chronic depressive symptoms, Gjerde (1995) showed that
early antagonistic personality traits and behaviors were
predictive of depressive symptoms in adolescent boys and
excessive feminine role socialization and introspection in
adolescent girls. Gender differences in the extent of
depressive symptoms emerge after the age of 13 in girls
but remain constant in boys (Hankin & Abramson,
2001). Girls may experience MDD more frequently than
boys because of developmental events that increase their
vulnerability and a cognitive set that fosters negativity
and rumination.
Researchers examining the effects of the family envi-
ronment have shown that family interactions of depressed
adolescents are characterized by more conflict, rejection,
less expression of emotion, and more abuse than those of
nondepressed youth (Birmaher et al., 1996b). Adolescents
and young adults with a history of childhood maltreat-
ment were 3 times more likely to become depressed or sui-
cidal than were individuals without such a history (Brown,
Cohen, Johnson, & Smailes, 1999). Poor adolescent inter-
personal functioning and negative self-assessment associ-
ated with maternal depression has been linked to early
onset (Hammen & Brennan, 2001) and sustained MDD
(Shiner & Marmorstein, 1998). Insecure attachment and
maternal negativity also have been linked to adolescent
depression (Pike & Plomin, 1996).
Certain personal attributes of adolescents have been
associated with MDD (Lewinsohn et al., 1998a). These
include negative cognition, a depressive attributional
style, low self-esteem, poor social competence and coping
skills, physical illness, reduced level of physical activity,
and tobacco use.
Life stressors occurring in adolescence also have been
associated with risk for MDD in adolescence. Adolescents
with MDD reported more frequent and severe stressors,
such as the death of a parent, parental divorce, or other
family disruption (Flament, Cohen, Choquet, Phillipe, &
Ledoux, 2001; Williamson et al., 1998). A large epidemi-
ologic study showed that a recent breakup with a
boyfriend or girlfriend is a significant risk factor for the
development of a single episode of MDD, but not recur-
rent MDD (Monroe, Rohde, Seeley, & Lewinsohn, 1999).
Other studies showed that negative life events, in the pres-
ence of dysfunctional attitudes, predicted the onset of
MDD in adolescents (Lewinshon, Joiner, & Rohde, 2001)
and its recurrence (Lewinsohn, Allen, Seeley, & Gotlib,
1999).
Ethnicity and Depression in Adolescence
At a time when the desire to be the same as those in
one’s peer group and to be accepted by them is at its high-
est, being different can heighten the risk for MDD. Few
studies describe differences in the rates of MDD among
minority adolescents or the effects of race on the develop-
ment of depressive disorder. A study compared non-
Hispanic White, African American, Mexican American,
and Japanese adolescents ages 12 to 14 and found that
the highest rates of MDD were present in Mexican Amer-
ican adolescents (Doi, Roberts, Takeuchi, & Suzuki,
2001). Rates of MDD ranged from 6.9% for Japanese
youth to 25.9% among Mexican Americans. These inves-
tigators focused on rates of impairment, that is, problems
at school, at home, or with peers. Another study found
that 18% of Mexican American girls and boys had
depressive symptoms in the range associated with MDD,
compared with 12.3% of non-Hispanic Whites (Roberts
& Chen, 1995). Two studies including Hispanic adoles-
cents showed no racial differences in the rates of MDD
(Kelder et al., 2001) or in the extent of depressive symp-
toms (Rushton, Forcier, & Schectman, 2002).
The gender disparity in the incidence of MDD extends
to adolescents of different ethnic origins. Only Japanese
girls had lower rates of MDD than boys; Mexican Amer-
ican girls had rates of MDD 1.5 times higher than boys.
A study of Native American detainees in a juvenile deten-
tion facility showed that 5.8% of males and 15.7% of
females had MDD (Duclos et al., 1998). It could be
argued that this sample is not representative of Native
American youth, however, because more than 75% of this
sample were detained for minor offenses such as curfew
violations.
In a study of depressed non-Hispanic White, Hispanic,
and African American adolescent girls, Rickert, Wie-
mann, and Berenson (2000) showed different patterns of
adolescent risk behaviors across the three ethnic groups.
Non-Hispanic White girls were more likely to be high
school dropouts, unemployed, binge drinkers, and sexu-

ally victimized. Hispanic girls were more likely to have
been victimized physically and to smoke. In contrast,
African American girls were more likely to be unem-
ployed and to smoke, but also to be the victims of sexual
abuse. Among depressed young minority adolescents,
rates of substance abuse were highest for Hispanic youth.
Clinical Course of Depression in Adolescents
The symptoms of MDD in adolescents mirror those of
adults but generally are milder. Symptoms may appear as
weight/appetite disturbances and feelings of worthlessness
and guilt in adolescent girls (Lewinsohn et al., 1998a).
Adolescents are likely to have their first episodes of MDD
at about age 15 (Kovacs, 1996). For girls, the first episode
of MDD is likely to occur at menarche. There is a higher
risk of MDD in girls who have early or late menarche. In
adolescents, the typical episode of MDD lasts between 2
and 9 months. Adolescents who have their first episode
early in puberty are more likely to have more severe
episodes that last longer (Lewinsohn et al., 1998a). MDD
that occurs in adolescents is likely to be recurrent (Samp-
son & Mrazek, 2001). The probability of recurrence is
40% by 2 and 70% by 5 years (Birmaher et al., 1996b).
Estimates of comorbidity with MDD in adolescents
range from 40% to 70% (Birmaher et al., 1996b). Ado-
lescents with MDD also commonly have DD, anxiety dis-
orders, disruptive disorders, and substance abuse. The
anxiety and disruptive disorders tend to appear before
MDD, whereas substance abuse tends to appear several
years following the index episode of MDD (Cicchetti &
Toth, 1998). Comorbidity complicates the treatment of
MDD and is associated with recurrent episodes and sui-
cide attempts. It also is associated with more impairment
in functioning, academic problems, and more conflict
with parents (Lewinsohn et al., 1998a).
MDD in adolescence can affect school and social func-
tioning. Some but not all investigations show declines in
academic performance and school difficulties (Birmaher
et al., 1996b; Flament et al., 2001; Rickert et al., 2000).
Of some concern is the association of MDD with adoles-
cent risk behavior. Initiation of smoking based on peer
pressure is more common among those with depressive
and anxiety symptoms (Patton et al., 1998). In another
study, MDD predicted the onset of smoking among ado-
lescents (Brown, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Wagner, 1996).
Rickert et al. (2000) showed that depressed adolescent
girls were more likely to binge drink and get drunk, drop
out of school, smoke, and be physically or sexually
assaulted. Another study showed that adolescent risk
behaviors were prevalent and aggregated in both boys
and girls with depressive symptoms (Tubman, Windle, &
Windle, 1996). A survey study examined the relationship
of carrying a weapon with other adolescent risk behaviors
(Kulig, Valentine, Griffith, & Ruthazer, 1998). Carrying a
weapon was associated with using marijuana, having sex-
ual experience, witnessing a crime, desiring to beat up
someone, and skipping school. It is alarming to note that
these risk behaviors also were associated with a signifi-
cant increased risk for thinking about or wanting to harm
oneself.
Suicide
Suicide is the third leading cause of death among
young people ages 15 to 24 years. Among adolescents
ages 15 to 19, the suicide rate was 9.5 per 100,000 or a
total of 1,802 successful suicides (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2000). Boys are
5 times more likely to commit suicide than are girls.
Among African American males ages 15 to 19, the rates
of suicide have increased rapidly. From 1980 to 1996, the
suicide rate among Black males more than doubled, from
3.6 in 100,000 to 8.1 in 100,000 (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1999), an increase of 105% (USDHHS,
2000). Homicides are prevalent among African American
males and may reflect suicidal behavior (Daugherty, 1999).
Death by firearm accounts for 63% of the increase in
suicide among adolescents. The vast majority of these
(67%) obtain the gun in their home (Shah, Hoffman,
Wake, & Marine, 2000). Alcohol also plays a role in sui-
cide completion among adolescents. States that have set
the minimum drinking age at 18 have higher rates of sui-
cide than those whose minimum is 21 (Birckmayer &
Hemenway, 1999).
Suicide attempts and suicidal ideation are also com-
mon among adolescents. The suicide attempt rate among
adolescents is estimated at 2.6% (USDHHS, 2000). Sui-
cide attempts are most common among girls (3.3%) and
Hispanics or Latinos (2.8%). About a quarter of adoles-
cents report suicidal ideation, and 15% report having a
plan to commit suicide (Rey, Narring, Ferron, &
Michaud, 1998).
As in adults, suicide in adolescence is associated with
mental illness (Lee, Collins, & Burgess, 1999). MDD is a
significant risk factor for suicide (Sampson & Mrazek,
2001). Other causes of suicidal behavior in adolescents
include family discord, the absence of biological parents,
physical abuse, unemployment, residential transience,
chronic behavior problems, and recent interpersonal
stress (Appleby, Cooper, Amos, & Faragher, 1999). Sub-
stance abuse increases the likelihood that ideation will
result in a suicide attempt (Gould et al., 1998). Among
adolescents reporting neglect or physical or sexual abuse,
51% attempt suicide (Lipschitz et al., 1999). Although
adolescents make more attempts than do adults, they gen-
erally are less successful (Safer, 1997). Suicide attempts by
adolescents also do not hold the same long-term risk for
suicide completion as they do for adults.
Rates of attempted suicide range from 20% to 42%
among gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth (GLB) (Remafedi,
March/April 2003
JOGNN 241
1999). Research has shown that 28% of gay/bisexual
males have attempted suicide, compared with 4.2% of
heterosexual males (Remafedi, French, Story, Resnick, &
Blum, 1998). Similarly, 20.5% of lesbian females report-
ed attempting suicide, compared with 14.5% of hetero-
sexual females. GLB youth ages 14 to 21 were 4 times
more likely to be depressed, 5 times more likely to think
about suicide, and 6 times more likely to attempt suicide
than heterosexual young people of the same age (Fergus-
son, Horwood, & Beautrais, 1999). Findings were almost
identical in a middle-aged group of GLB adults (Herrell
et al., 1999). GLB youth who “came out” to their fami-
lies reported more suicidal behavior than those who did not
tell their families about their homosexuality (D’Augelli,
Hershberger, & Pilkington, 1998). Other research exam-
ining predictors of GLB suicidality has shown that the
extent of current suicidality of GLB does not differ from
heterosexual adolescents when environmental variables
are controlled (Safren & Heimberg, 1999).
Assessment
Assessment of Depression
Depressed adolescents seek treatment in every health
sector. Nurses practicing in diverse health settings are well
positioned to detect MDD. Because the symptoms of
MDD in adults and adolescents are congruent, the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual 4th Edition—Text Revision
criteria (APA, 2000) can be used to determine if MDD is
present in the patient. Typically, MDD is diagnosed by
administering systematic and standardized clinical inter-
views (Puig-Antich & Ryan, 1986; Schwab-Stone et al.,
1993; Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, & First, 1992; Welner,
Reich, Herjanic, Jung, & Amado, 1987). Standardized
interviews are considered the “gold standard” for estab-
lishing the diagnosis of MDD but often are cumbersome
in general pediatrics and other primary care settings.
Recently, a short patient-administered diagnostic instru-
ment for use in primary care settings, The Patient Health
Questionnaire, was developed (Spitzer, Kroenke,
Williams, & the Patient Health Questionnaire Study
Group, 1999). Although the instrument has been psycho-
metrically evaluated only in adults, its brevity and ease of
administration may make it a useful diagnostic instrument
for adolescents in pediatric and primary care settings.
There are several self-administered instruments avail-
able that can be used to screen adolescents for MDD. The
Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-
D) (Radloff, 1977), a commonly used instrument, is avail-
able from the National Institute for Mental Health and on
the Internet. Another is the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988). The earliest versions
of this instrument are available for public use, but later
versions are not. Specific to children is the Children’s
Depression Inventory (CDI) (Kovacs, 1980/1981) normed
for children ages 7 to 17 years. Each of these screening
instruments takes less than 10 minutes to complete.
The easiest screening method is to ask the following
questions:
1. During the past month, have you been bothered by
feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
2. During the last month, have you often been both-
ered by having little interest or pleasure in doing
things?
A response of yes to either of these questions is considered
a positive screening, and further assessment is warranted.
These two questions alone reliably identify about 65% of
persons with MDD (Whooley, Avins, Miranda, & Brown-
er, 1997).
There are several other clues that an adolescent may be
depressed (Lewinsohn et al., 1998a). Excessive negativity,
irritability, criticism of self and others, and sarcasm may
be signs of MDD in some teenagers. Self-consciousness,
low self-esteem, difficulty in social situations, and diffi-
culty coping are other behaviors that should raise the pos-
sibility of a depressive disorder, especially in girls. Poor
social support may be another indicator of MDD.
Depressed teenagers often feel alienated from family and
friends and may engage in behavior that further isolates
them. Some adolescents will decrease their physical activ-
ities. Adolescents often begin smoking when they are
depressed, so this can be a sign of emotional distress.
A final line of inquiry is assessment of family history
and recent stressful events. Adolescents who are
depressed often have a parent who is or has been
depressed. For adolescents, a key question is whether a
family member has attempted or completed suicide
(Cerel, Fristad, Weller, & Weller, 1999). Familial expo-
sure to suicide often increases suicidal risk in the adoles-
cent. Stressful events in the life of the adolescent also are
associated with greater risk for MDD. Negative events
affecting peers, family, and school life are key in assessing
MDD risk.
The adolescent is the best source of information about
depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. The internal-

T
he easiest screening method is to ask
the following questions: During the past
month have you been bothered by feeling
down, depressed, or hopeless? During the
last month have you often been bothered by
little interest or pleasure in doing things?
izing behavior associated with MDD often is not readily
apparent to parents and peers. To determine concurrent
psychopathology, however, parents often are a better
source of information than the adolescent, who may be
reluctant to report negative behavior. Observers can more
easily quantify behaviors associated with conduct and
anxiety disorders. Note that parents can both minimize or
overestimate symptoms, especially if they are emotionally
distressed, as is often the case when an adolescent requires
psychiatric intervention.
Suicide Assessment
It is vital to assess for suicide risk in adolescents. It has
been estimated that approximately 40% of people who
commit suicide have visited a health care provider within
1 to 6 months of their suicide attempt (Purcell, Thrush, &
Blanchette, 1999). Asking about a patient’s suicidal
thoughts is difficult. Many providers mistakenly believe
that asking someone about their suicidal thoughts is dis-
turbing to the patient and may provoke a suicide attempt.
To the contrary, inquiry about suicidal ideation often is
comforting to the patient because the thoughts are fright-
ening and asking about them normalizes the situation for
the patient. There is no better method of suicide preven-
tion than querying about suicidal intent.
Several scales are available to assess suicide risk. One
of these is the Suicide Intent Scale (Beck, Kovacs, &
Weissman, 1979), an eight-item self-report measure. A
series of questions useful in assessing suicide intent and
planning appears in Table 1 (Hauenstein, 2001). The best
question to ask is, “Have you ever had a period of time
where you felt so bad that you thought about or tried to
kill or hurt yourself?”
When a nurse or other care provider determines that a
patient has serious suicide intent, it is important to get
help. The patient should not be left alone, and the clini-
cian should call his or her supervisor, an experienced psy-
chiatric nurse, or other mental health clinician immedi-
ately. Even those who are experienced mental health
providers should not try to manage a potentially suicidal
patient without help. Even the most experienced mental
health professional may lose a patient during treatment
because of suicide (Clark, 1995). The health care provider
is one of the people who must cope with the aftermath of
a completed suicide. For this reason, even highly experi-
enced professionals are better prepared to meet the chal-
lenges of a completed suicide when they work with other
providers who are experienced in caring for suicidal clients.
The Web site www.siec.ca/resources/ (helpcard) pro-
vides a short checklist of things to do when a client is sui-
cidal. A synopsis of the helpcard appears in Table 2.
Another resource is a single-page, fill-in-the-blanks note
that the adolescent can give to significant others if the
adolescent is having difficulty expressing his or her suici-
dal intent. These are located at www.suicideteens.com/
helpcard and can be left in the waiting room or other
place where adolescents are likely to see them.
Treatment
Despite its prevalence, MDD remains undertreated or
untreated. Studies of adolescents show treatment rates of
34.7% to 61% (Flament et al., 2001; Lewinsohn, Rohde,
& Seely, 1998b). These studies show that only 16% of
those treated received adequate care. Low treatment rates
are especially troubling, because untreated depressed ado-
lescents grow up to be depressed adults (Weissman et al.,
1999). These investigators found that depressed adoles-
cents have a suicide rate of 7.7%, a fivefold increased risk
for a first suicide attempt; twice the risk of MDD, psychi-
atric, and medical hospitalizations; and impairment in
their work, family, and social lives. Lack of physician time
and training and reduced compensation for treatment of
psychiatric disorders have been associated with poor
treatment in pediatric settings (Sampson & Mrazek,
2001). It should be noted that evidence-based treatments
for adolescents are not well developed because, until

recently, MDD was not considered an illness of childhood
and adolescence (Kazdin & Weisz, 1998).
Medication
There have been few randomized controlled trials
measuring the efficacy of medication for adolescent
MDD. Eleven controlled studies have been conducted
evaluating the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressant medica-
tions (TCA) such as imipramine (Keller et al., 2001).
There was no evidence that the efficacy of TCAs is supe-
rior to that of a placebo (Birmaher et al., 1996a; Sampson
& Mrazek, 2001). That there are significant side effects of
these medications and that they are highly lethal in over-
dose militates against their use in adolescents. There are
preliminary data that the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating MDD in ado-
lescents (Birmaher et al., 1996a; Keller et al., 2001; Samp-
son & Mrazek, 2001). The majority of research has been
open-label studies showing that fluoxetine (Prozac, Eli
Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) and paroxetine (Paxil, Glaxo-
SmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) were superior
to placebo in reducing symptoms of MDD in adolescents.
Two placebo studies with Prozac, however, were equivo-
cal in their results. A recent randomized, placebo-con-
trolled trial found that there was a modest improvement
in the clinical ratings of mood, but not in functioning and
self-esteem, when comparing Paxil, imipramine, and
placebo (Keller et al., 2001). Although Paxil was effective
when compared with placebo, imipramine was not.
With the exception of the Keller et al. (2001) study, sig-
nificant methodological problems undermine the validity
of the findings. Many of these were research design prob-
lems; for example, having too few participants. Several
aspects of adolescent development also cloud the evalua-
tion of medication efficacy (Birmaher et al., 1996a). First,
adolescents respond to placebo medication at rates of
50% to 70%. In the Keller et al. (2001) study, which used
three independent measures of MDD, the placebo
response ranged from 46% to 55.2%. It is difficult to
ascertain the efficacy of any medication when placebo
responses are so high.
Another issue concerns the physiological changes of
adolescence (Birmaher et al., 1996b). The hormonal sys-
tem disarray of adolescence affects the efficacy of med-
ication. The noradrenergic system is underdeveloped in
adolescents, and this system may not be as effectively
stimulated as in adults. Adolescents metabolize medica-
tion at a faster rate than do adults, which complicates the
prescription and titration of antidepressants. There also is
evidence that medication distribution and protein binding
is different for adolescents than for adults. Given the lim-
ited research on the efficacy of medications or their long-
term effects in adolescents, the prescription of an SSRI for
an adolescent requires careful consideration.
Psychotherapy
There are better empirical data on the effectiveness of
psychotherapy in remission and recovery from MDD in
adolescents. In a review of psychotherapy outcome
research, Kazdin and Weisz (1998) identified psychother-
apeutic treatment modalities that have the most com-
pelling evidence of their efficacy with adolescents. For
adolescents with MDD, coping skills training (CST) has
been shown to be effective (Lewisohn et al., 1998b). CST
borrows heavily from Beck’s cognitive theory of MDD
and, to a lesser extent, stress diathesis models (Beck,
Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Lewinsohn et al., 2001).
This group therapy is divided into several topics and
provided in 2-hour sessions twice a week for a total of 16
sessions. CST starts with social skills training, an area of
great concern to teenagers. Training in relaxation using
progressive muscle relaxation follows social skills train-
ing. Relaxation is used to reduce social anxiety. Next,
cognitive restructuring is introduced, with an emphasis on
increasing positive and decreasing negative thoughts and
challenging irrational thoughts. Learning to increase
pleasurable activities also is part of cognitive restructur-
ing. Basic negotiation and problem-solving skills are devel-
oped next, particularly to reduce negative child-parent
interactions. To prevent further episodes of MDD, ado-
lescents identify individual triggers to mood changes and
depressive symptoms and learn to recognize the reappear-
ance of these symptoms. Adolescents are given a work-
book and are expected to do homework in CST.

CST has been shown to be effective in two randomized
controlled clinical trials (Lewinsohn et al., 1998a). In the
first trial, 46% of adolescents treated with CST no longer
met criteria for MDD, compared with 5% of the wait list
controls. At 6 months, 84% of treated adolescents had
recovered. The second trial of CST also was successful.
Immediately after treatment, 67% of treated adolescents
no longer met criteria for MDD, compared with 46% of
controls. One year after treatment, 81% of treated ado-
lescents were recovered from their MDD. Note that most
depressive episodes in adolescents will remit sponta-
neously within 1 year. Two-year data are more convinc-
ing, as only 2% of treated adolescents met criteria for
MDD posttreatment.
Other forms of therapy also have been found to be use-
ful with adolescents (Kazdin & Weisz, 1998). In cognitive
behavioral therapy, adolescents learn to identify negative
thoughts and attributions, develop positive thoughts,
engage in pleasurable activities, and challenge irrational
thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes. Several studies have
shown the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy, but
the research does not yet meet the criteria for evidence-
based practice. Interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic
therapy, and family therapy also are used in the treatment
of adolescents with MDD.
Other Treatments
Psychoeducation. In addition to depression detection
and suicide prevention, nurses can do much to improve
the physical, psychological, and social functioning of ado-
lescents with MDD. Because MDD has biological, psy-
chological, and social roots, it is important to assess the
extent to which the adolescent is engaging in healthy
behaviors. Alterations in appetite attendant with MDD
can result in either excessive weight gain or loss. The
nurse can help the adolescent and his or her family to
devise strategies to improve nutrition. Assessment for the
presence of an eating disorder, especially anorexia ner-
vosa, may be warranted. Adolescents who have MDD are
not motivated to eat, so serving small frequent meals with
high nutritional value will promote the development of
biogenic amines that are depleted in MDD. For those with
atypical MDD, craving of sweets and excessive weight
gain are the norm. This is especially distressing to girls
because of the social imperatives to remain thin. Becom-
ing overweight as a consequence of MDD often diminish-
es the already fragile self-esteem of adolescent girls.
Depressed adolescents often have disturbances in their
sleep. These are further exacerbated by an adolescent
lifestyle where rising and bedtime are irregular. The nurse
should emphasize the role of regular sleep in promoting
recovery from MDD and work with the adolescent and
parents to establish a sleep routine. Adolescents also
should be encouraged to exercise. Exercise results in more
resistance to stressful events. For boys, exercise is espe-
cially helpful in managing anger that often accompanies
MDD. For girls it provides a mechanism for reducing
overall caloric intake and helps them to feel more in con-
trol of what is happening to them. The nurse should cau-
tion the adolescent that cigarette smoking and use of alco-
hol and other addicting substances should be avoided
because of their role in promoting MDD.
Motivation is generally diminished in MDD, so ado-
lescents must learn the relationship between healthy
behaviors and depression outcomes. Adolescents are
much more likely to engage in healthy behavior when
they know it will have some bearing on their depressive
symptoms. Parents also should be instructed about the
need for a healthy lifestyle so they can promote these pos-
itive behaviors in their youngsters.
Social Skills Training. A major component of CST is
social skills training. There is nothing more important to
adolescents than the goodwill of their peers. This is an
important motivating factor that can be used to engage
teenagers in treatment. Nurses can help depressed adoles-
cents to learn conversational techniques, plan social activ-
ities, and develop strategies for making new friends.
Nurses also can teach adolescents the relaxation tech-
niques that are used in CST to help adolescents control
their anxiety in social situations. Changes in the body that
occur in adolescents are often embarrassing socially.
Nurses can help them understand what is happening in
their bodies and what is normal. For example, nurses can
help adolescents learn techniques to control acne, often a
source of concern to pubescent teenagers.
Developing Social Support. In addition to being isolat-
ed from friends and peers, depressed adolescents often are
alienated from their families. This is a source of signifi-
cant distress to young people and contributes to the
depressive symptoms. Depression often manifests itself in
teenagers through increasing conflict with parents. Par-
ents view the oppositional, defiant, and often withdrawn
behaviors as disrespectful and respond punitively. Even if
they recognize that their child is depressed, parents may
expect the adolescent to get his or her symptoms under
control because of negative biases parents may have
about mental illness. This further alienates the adolescent
and perpetuates the cycle of conflict. Parents need to learn

encouraging a healthy lifestyle, enhancing social
skills, and assisting the adolescent to identify
and use sources of social support.
about MDD, including its triggers, etiology, behavioral
consequences, and treatment. They may need help pro-
viding the structure and support necessary to promote
recovery in their adolescent. The nurse also can help the
patient identify other sources of social support, including
grandparents, teachers, coaches, peers, or church groups.
Summary
Major depressive disorder is a common problem for
many adolescents. Girls are especially prone to MDD and
are diagnosed twice as often as boys. Teenagers of Mexi-
can American ethnicity are especially at risk. MDD has a
wide array of symptoms affecting somatic, cognitive,
affective, and social processes. Academic failure, poor
peer relationships, behavioral problems, conflict with
parents and other authority figures, and substance abuse
are some of the consequences of MDD. The risk of suicide
is significant in depressed adolescents and especially in
non-Hispanic White males.
Early and aggressive treatment of adolescents can
shorten episodes of MDD and reduce the risk for subse-
quent episodes. Effective treatments include SSRIs and
coping skills training. The nurse is key to depression
detection and suicide prevention, especially in primary
care settings. Questioning adolescents and using depres-
sion screening instruments aid in identifying MDD in this
group. Through psychoeducation, nurses can promote
recovery from MDD by encouraging a healthy lifestyle,
enhancing social skills, and assisting the adolescent to
identify and use sources of social support. These measures
can prevent adolescents’ premature death and promote
long-term well-being.

12869766,True,True,"In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, we tested why stressful experiences lead to depression in some people but not in others. A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (5-HT T) gene was found to moderate the influence of stressful life events on depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HT T promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides evidence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual's response to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.","DOI: 10.1126/science.1083968

tivity (25) that investigated two tasks with right
hemisphere dominance demonstrated top-down
effects that were specific for the right hemi-
sphere, i.e., from the right middle frontal gyrus
(area 46) on right extrastriate areas. It is thus
likely that our findings generalize to other later-
alized tasks. Although we cannot exclude later-
alization contingent on stimulus type in some
situations, our results are consistent with previ-
ous findings from split-brain patient studies (7)
and positron emission tomography (11) showing
hemispheric specialization based on task de-
mands. Research on hemispheric specialization
should move beyond analyses of asymmetric
regional activations and focus more strongly on
functional interactions within and between
hemispheres.

In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, we tested
why stressful experiences lead to depression in some people but not in others.
A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
(5-HTT) gene was found to moderate the inﬂuence of stressful life events on
depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HTT
promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable
depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals
homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides ev-
idence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual’s response
to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.
Depression is among the top five leading causes
of disability and disease burden throughout the
world (1). Across the life span, stressful life
events that involve threat, loss, humiliation, or
defeat influence the onset and course of depres-
sion (2–5). However, not all people who en-
counter a stressful life experience succumb to
its depressogenic effect. Diathesis-stress theo-
ries of depression predict that individuals’ sen-
sitivity to stressful events depends on their ge-
netic makeup (6, 7). Behavioral genetics re-
search supports this prediction, documenting
that the risk of depression after a stressful event
is elevated among people who are at high ge-
netic risk and diminished among those at low
genetic risk (8). However, whether specific
genes exacerbate or buffer the effect of stressful
life events on depression is unknown. In this
study, a functional polymorphism in the pro-

moter region of the serotonin transporter gene
(SLC6A4) was used to characterize genetic vul-
nerability to depression and to test whether
5-HTT gene variation moderates the influence
of life stress on depression.
The serotonin system provides a logical
source of candidate genes for depression, be-
cause this system is the target of selective
serotonin reuptake–inhibitor drugs that are
effective in treating depression (9). The sero-
tonin transporter has received particular at-
tention because it is involved in the reuptake
of serotonin at brain synapses (10). The pro-
moter activity of the 5-HTT gene, located on
17q11.2, is modified by sequence elements
within the proximal 5 regulatory region, des-
ignated the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR). The short (“s”) allele in
the 5-HTTLPR is associated with lower tran-
scriptional efficiency of the promoter com-
pared with the long (“l”) allele (11).
Evidence for an association between the
short promoter variant and depression is incon-
clusive (12). Although the 5-HTT gene may not
be directly associated with depression, it could
moderate the serotonergic response to stress.
Three lines of experimental research suggest
this hypothesis of a gene-by-environment (G 
E) interaction. First, in mice with disrupted
5-HTT, homozygous and heterozygous (5-HTT
–/– and /–) strains exhibited more fearful
behavior and greater increases in the stress hor-
mone (plasma) adrenocorticotropin in response
to stress compared to homozygous (5-HTT
/) controls, but in the absence of stress no
differences related to genotype were observed
(13). Second, in rhesus macaques, whose length
variation of the 5-HTTLPR is analogous to that
of humans, the short allele is associated with
decreased serotonergic function [lower cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
concentrations] among monkeys reared in
stressful conditions but not among normally
reared monkeys (14). Third, human neuroim-
aging research suggests that the stress response
is mediated by variations in the 5-HTTLPR.
Humans with one or two copies of the s allele
exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity to
fearful stimuli compared to individuals ho-
mozygous for the l allele (15). Taken together,
these findings suggest the hypothesis that vari-
ations in the 5-HTT gene moderate psycho-
pathological reactions to stressful experiences.
We tested this G  E hypothesis among
members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary
Health and Development Study (16). This
representative birth cohort of 1037 children
(52% male) has been assessed at ages 3, 5, 7,
9, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 21 and was virtually
intact (96%) at the age of 26 years. A total of
847 Caucasian non-Maori study members,
without stratification confounds, were divid-
ed into three groups on the basis of their
5-HTTLPR genotype (11): those with two
copies of the s allele (s/s homozygotes; n 
147; 17%), those with one copy of the s allele
(s/l heterozygotes; n  435; 51%), and those
with two copies of the l allele (l/l homozy-
gotes; n  265; 31%). There was no differ-
ence in genotype frequencies between the
sexes [2(2)  0.02, P  0.99]. Stressful life
events occurring after the 21st birthday and
before the 26th birthday were assessed with
the aid of a life-history calendar (17), a high-
ly reliable method for ascertaining life-event
histories (18). The 14 events included em-
ployment, financial, housing, health, and re-
lationship stressors. Thirty percent of the
study members experienced no stressful life
events; 25% experienced one event; 20%,
two events; 11%, three events; and 15%, four
or more events. There were no significant
differences
between
the
three
genotype
groups in the number of life events they
experienced, F(2,846)  0.56, P  0.59,
suggesting that 5-HTTLPR genotype did not
influence exposure to stressful life events.
Study members were assessed for past-year
depression at age 26 with the use of the Diag-
nostic Interview Schedule (19), which yields a
quantitative measure of depressive symptoms
and a categorical diagnosis of a major depres-
sive episode according to Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)
criteria (20). 17% of study members (58% fe-
male versus 42% male; odds ratio  1.6; 95%
confidence interval from 1.1 to 2.2) met criteria
for a past-year major depressive episode, which
is comparable to age and sex prevalence rates
observed in U.S. epidemiological studies (21).
In addition, 3% of the study members reported
past-year suicide attempts or recurrent thoughts
about suicide in the context of a depressive
episode. We also collected informant reports
about symptoms of depression for 96% of study
members at age 26 by mailing a brief question-
naire to persons nominated by each study mem-
ber as “someone who knows you well.”
We used a moderated regression frame-
work (22), with sex as a covariate, to test the
association between depression and (i) 5-
HTTLPR genotype, (ii) stressful life events,
and (iii) their interaction (table S1). The in-
teraction between 5-HTTLPR and life events
showed that the effect of life events on self-
reports of depression symptoms at age 26 was
significantly stronger (P  0.02) among in-
dividuals carrying an s allele than among l/l
homozygotes (Fig. 1A). We further tested
whether life events could predict within-indi-
vidual increases in depression symptoms over
time among individuals with an s allele by
statistically controlling for the baseline num-
ber of depressive symptoms they had before
the life events occurred (table S1). The sig-
nificant interaction (P  0.05) showed that
individuals carrying an s allele whose life
events occurred after their 21st birthday ex-
perienced increases in depressive symptoms
from the age of 21 to 26 years (b  1.55,
SE  0.66, t  2.35, P  0.02 among s/s
homozygotes and b  1.25, SE  0.34, t 
3.66, P  0.001 among s/l heterozygotes)
whereas l/l homozygotes did not (b  0.17,
SE  0.41, t  0.41, P  0.68).
The G  E interaction also showed that
stressful life events predicted a diagnosis of
major depression among carriers of an s allele
but not among l/l homozygotes (P  0.056,
Fig. 1B). We further tested whether life
events could predict the onset of new diag-
nosed depression among carriers of an s allele
(table S1). We excluded from analysis study
members who were diagnosed with depres-
sion before age 21. The significant interac-
tion (P  0.02) showed that life events oc-
curring after their 21st birthdays predicted
depression at age 26 among carriers of an s
allele who did not have a prior history of
depression (b  0.79, SE  0.25, z  3.16,
P  0.002 among s/s homozygotes and b 
0.41, SE  0.12, z  3.29, P  0.001 among
s/l heterozygotes) but did not predict onset of
new depression among l/l homozygotes (b 
0.08, SE  0.20, z  0.42, P  0.67). Further
analyses showed that stressful life events pre-
dicted suicide ideation or attempt among in-
dividuals carrying an s allele but not among
l/l homozygotes (P  0.05, Fig. 1C). The
hypothesized G  E interaction was also
significant when we predicted informant re-
ports of age-26 depression (P  0.01), an
analysis that ruled out the possibility of self-
report bias (Fig. 1D). The interaction showed
that the effect of life events on informant
reports of depression was stronger among
individuals carrying an s allele than among l/l
homozygotes. These analyses attest that the
5-HTT gene interacts with life events to pre-
dict depression symptoms, an increase in
symptoms, depression diagnoses, new-onset
diagnoses, suicidality, and an informant’s re-
port of depressed behavior.
This evidence that 5-HTTLPR variation
moderates the effect of life events on depres-
sion does not constitute unambiguous evi-
dence of a G  E interaction, because expo-
sure to life events may be influenced by
genetic factors; if individuals have a heritable
tendency to enter situations where they en-
counter stressful life events, these events may
simply be a genetically saturated marker (23,
24). Thus, what we have identified as a
gene  environment interaction predicting
depression could actually reflect a gene 
“gene” interaction between the 5-HTTLPR
and other genes we did not measure. We
reasoned that, if our measure of life events
represents merely genetic risk, then life
events would interact with 5-HTTLPR even
if they occurred after the depression episode.
However, if our measure of life events rep-
resents environmental stress, then the timing
of life events relative to depression must
follow cause-effect order and life events that

occur after depression should not interact
with 5-HTTLPR to postdict depression. We
tested this hypothesis by substituting the age-
26 measure of depression with depression
assessed in this longitudinal study when
study members were 21 and 18 years old,
before the occurrence of the measured life
events between the ages of 21 and 26 years.
Whereas the 5-HTTLPR  life events inter-
action predicted depression at the age of 26
years, this same interaction did not postdict
depression reported at age 21 nor at the age of
18 years (table S2), indicating our finding is
a true G  E interaction.
If 5-HTT genotype moderates the depres-
sogenic influence of stressful life events, it
should moderate the effect of life events that
occurred not just in adulthood but also of
stressful experiences that occurred in earlier
developmental periods. Based on this hypoth-
esis, we tested whether adult depression was
predicted by the interaction between 5-
HTTLPR and childhood maltreatment that
occurred during the first decade of life (16,
25). Consistent with the G  E hypothesis,
the longitudinal prediction from childhood
maltreatment to adult depression was signif-
icantly moderated by 5-HTTLPR (table S3).
The interaction showed (P  0.05) that child-
hood maltreatment predicted adult depression
only among individuals carrying an s allele
but not among l/l homozygotes (Fig. 2).
We previously showed that variations in
the gene encoding the neurotransmitter-me-
tabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A
(MAOA) moderate children’s sensitivity to
maltreatment (25). MAOA has high affinity
for 5-HTT, raising the possibility that the
protective effect of the l/l allele on psychiat-
ric morbidity is further augmented by the
presence of a genotype conferring high
MAOA activity (13, 26). However, we found
that the moderation of life stress on depres-
sion was specific to a polymorphism in the
5-HTT gene, because this effect was ob-
served regardless of the individual’s MAOA
gene status (tables S4 and S5).
Until this study’s findings are replicated,
speculation about clinical implications is pre-

mature. Nonetheless, although carriers of an s
5-HTTLPR allele who experienced four or
more life events constituted only 10% of the
birth cohort, they accounted for almost one-
quarter (23%) of the 133 cases of diagnosed
depression. Moreover, among cohort mem-
bers suffering four or more stressful life
events, 33% of individuals with an s allele
became depressed, whereas only 17% of the
l/l homozygotes developed depression (Fig.
3). Thus, the G  E’s attributable risk and
predictive
sensitivity
indicate
that
more
knowledge about the functional properties of
the 5-HTT gene may lead to better pharma-
cological treatments for those already de-
pressed. Although the short 5-HTTLPR vari-
ant is too prevalent for discriminatory screen-
ing (over half of the Caucasian population
has an s allele), a microarray of genes might
eventually identify those needing prophylaxis
against life’s stressful events (27).
Evidence of a direct relation between the
5-HTTLPR and depression has been incon-
sistent (12), perhaps because prior studies
have not considered participants’ stress his-
tories. In this study, no direct association
between the 5-HTT gene and depression was
observed. Previous experimental paradigms,
including 5-HTT knockout mice (13), stress-
reared rhesus macaques (14), and human
functional neuroimaging (15), have shown
that the 5-HTT gene can interact with envi-
ronmental conditions, although these experi-
ments did not address depression. Our study
demonstrates that this G  E interaction ex-
tends to the natural development of depres-
sion in a representative sample of humans.
However, we could not test hypotheses about
brain endophenotypes (28) intermediate be-
tween the 5-HTT gene and depression be-
cause of the difficulty of taking CSF or func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging measure-
ments in an epidemiological cohort.
Much genetic research has been guided by
the assumption that genes cause diseases, but
the expectation that direct paths will be found
from gene to disease has not proven fruitful for
complex psychiatric disorders (29). Our find-
ings of G  E interaction for the 5-HTT gene
and another candidate gene, MAOA (25), point
to a different, evolutionary model. This model
assumes that genetic variants maintained at
high prevalence in the population probably act
to promote organisms’ resistance to environ-
mental pathogens (30). We extend the concept
of environmental pathogens to include traumat-
ic, stressful life experiences and propose that
the effects of genes may be uncovered when
such pathogens are measured (in naturalistic
studies) or manipulated (in experimental stud-
ies). To date, few linkage studies detect genes,
many candidate gene studies fail consistent rep-
lication, and genes that replicate account for
little variation in the phenotype (29). If repli-
cated, our G  E findings will have implica-
tions for improving research in psychiatric ge-
netics. Incomplete gene penetrance, a major
source of error in linkage pedigrees, can be
explained if a gene’s effects are expressed only
among family members exposed to environ-
mental risk. If risk exposure differs between
samples, candidate genes may fail replication.
If risk exposure differs among participants
within a sample, genes may account for little
variation in the phenotype. We speculate that
some multifactorial disorders, instead of result-
ing from variations in many genes of small
effect, may result from variations in fewer
genes whose effects are conditional on expo-
sure to environmental risks.

BACKGROUND.
A
number
of
self-
administered questionnaires are available for
assessing depression severity, including the
9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depres-
sion module (PHQ-9). Because even briefer
measures might be desirable for use in busy
clinical settings or as part of comprehensive
health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item
version of the PHQ depression module, the
PHQ-2.
METHODS. The PHQ-2 inquires about the
frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia
over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 (“not at
all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The PHQ-2 was
completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care
clinics and 7 obstetrics–gynecology clinics.
Construct validity was assessed using the 20-
item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-
reported
sick
days
and
clinic
visits,
and
symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity
was assessed against an independent struc-
tured mental health professional (MHP) inter-
view in a sample of 580 patients.
RESULTS. As PHQ-2 depression severity in-
creased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial
decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20
subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty,
sick days, and healthcare utilization increased.
Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion
standard, a PHQ-2 score >3 had a sensitivity of
83% and a specificity of 92% for major depres-
sion. Likelihood ratio and receiver operator
characteristic analysis identified a PHQ-2 score
of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening
purposes. Results were similar in the primary
care and obstetrics–gynecology samples.
CONCLUSION. The construct and criterion va-
lidity of the PHQ-2 make it an attractive mea-
sure for depression screening.

Depression is a prevalent and disabling condi-
tion in the general medical setting. Although
many patients with depression receive care exclu-
sively in the primary care rather than mental
health sector, up to half of depression cases in
primary care go unrecognized.1,2 The U.S. Preven-
tive Services Task Force recently concluded that
there is sufficient evidence to recommend periodic
screening
for
depression.1
Numerous
well-
validated questionnaires are available for depres-
sion screening and are similar in terms of their
operating characteristics as case-finding instru-
ments.2–4 One particularly popular instrument is

Health Questionnaire, the PHQ-9. Validated in
6000 patients, the PHQ-9 serves as both a depres-
sion severity measure as well as a diagnostic
instrument for the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV),
depressive disorders.5
However, even shorter measures could be de-
sirable in some circumstances. First, the busy
nature and competing demands of primary care
practice make efficiency a particularly important
attribute of any new measure.6–8 Second, depres-
sion is only one of the many disorders for which
screening in primary care is encouraged. Thus,
brief depression measures could be incorporated
as part of comprehensive health questionnaires
administered to either patients new to a practice or
established patients on a periodic basis. Keeping
to a minimum the number of items asked about a
single disorder is an important factor to maintain a
reasonable length for such questionnaires. The
same might be true for research studies in which
depression is a secondary rather than primary
variable, and asking a few rather than many items
can reduce respondent burden.
Therefore, we examined the operating charac-
teristics of 2 items from the PHQ-9, depressed
mood and anhedonia, which we call the PHQ-2.
Previous research has shown that a single ques-
tion about depressed mood has a sensitivity of
85% to 90% for major depression,3,9 and adding a
second question about anhedonia increases the
sensitivity to 95%.3 The PHQ-2 asks respondents
to estimate the frequency of these 2 symptoms
over the past 2 weeks with 4 response options
ranging from “not at all”to “nearly everyday.”Data
are analyzed from the 2 major PHQ studies in-
volving 3000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and
3000 patients in 7 obstetrics–gynecology clin-
ics.10,11 Our aims were to assess the criterion and
construct validity of the PHQ-2.
Methods
Description of the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2
The PHQ-9 is the 9-item depression module
from the full PHQ.5 Major depressive disorder is
diagnosed if 5 or more of the 9 depressive symp-
tom criteria have been present at least “more than
half the days”in the past 2 weeks, and one of the
symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. “Oth-
er depressive disorder” is diagnosed if 2, 3, or 4
depressive symptoms have been present at least
“more than half the days”in the past 2 weeks and
one of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhe-
donia. One of the 9 symptom criteria (“thoughts
that you would be better off dead or of hurting
yourself in some way”) counts as one of the
diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders if
present at all, regardless of duration. Like with the
original PRIME-MD (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY),
the clinician is expected to rule out physical causes
of depression, normal bereavement, and history of
a manic episode.
The PHQ-2 includes the first 2 items of the
PHQ-9. The stem question is, “Over the last 2
weeks, how often have you been bothered by any
of the following problems?”The 2 items are “little
interest or pleasure in doing things” and “feeling
down, depressed, or hopeless.”For each item, the
response options are “not at all,” “several days,”
“more than half the days,”and “nearly everyday,”
scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Thus, the
PHQ-2 score can range from 0 to 6.
PHQ Study Samples and Procedures
From May 1997 to November 1998, 3890 pa-
tients, 18 years or older, were invited to participate
in the PHQ Primary Care Study.10 There were 190
who declined to participate, 266 who started but
did not complete the questionnaire (often because
there was an inadequate time before seeing their
physician), and 434 whose questionnaires were
not entered into the dataset because the equiva-
lent of approximately one page (20 items) was not
completed. This resulted in the 3000 primary care
patients reported here (1422 from 5 general inter-
nal medicine clinics and 1578 from 3 family prac-
tice clinics). From May 1997 to March 1999, 3636
patients, 18 years or older, were approached to
participate in the PHQ Obstetrics–Gynecology
Study.11 There were 245 patients who declined to
participate, 127 who started but did not complete
the questionnaire, and 264 whose questionnaires
were not entered into the dataset because the
equivalent of approximately one page was not
completed. This resulted in the 3000 subjects from
7 obstetrics–gynecology sites. The 2 PHQ studies
enrolled patients from 8 states (New York, Massa-
chusetts, Utah, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Ohio,
and Wisconsin) plus the District of Columbia.
All sites used 1 of 2 subject selection methods to
minimize sampling bias: either consecutive pa-

tients for a given clinic session or every nth patient
until the intended quota for that session was
achieved. Patient characteristics are summarized in
detail elsewhere.5 Briefly, the primary care sample
was 66% women, 21% minority in terms of race/
ethnicity, and had a mean age of 46 years. The
obstetrics–gynecology sample was 100% women,
61% minority, and had a mean age of 31 years. The
Institutional Review Board at each site approved
the study protocol.
Before seeing the physician, all patients com-
pleted the full self-administered PHQ. Also, they
completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short-
Form General Health Survey (SF-20).12 The SF-20
measures functional status in 6 domains (all scores
from 0–100, 100  best health). Additionally,
patients estimated the number of physician visits
and disability days during the past 3 months.
Mental Health Professional Validation
Interviews
To determine the agreement of PHQ diagnoses
with those of mental health professionals (MHPs),
midway through the PHQ Primary Care Study, an
MHP (a PhD clinical psychologist or 1 of 3 senior
psychiatric social workers) attempted to interview
by telephone all subsequently entered subjects
who had a telephone, agreed to be interviewed,
and could be contacted within 48 hours. All except
one site participated in these validation interviews.
The MHP was blinded to the results of the PHQ.
The rationale and further details of the MHP
telephone interview, which used the overview
from the SCID (structured clinical interview for
DSM-III-R)13 and diagnostic questions from the
PRIME-MD,
are
described
in
the
original
PRIME-MD report.14 The 580 subjects who had a
MHP interview within 48 hours of completing the
PHQ were, within each site, similar to patients not
reinterviewed in terms of demographic profile,
functional status, and frequency of psychiatric
diagnoses. Agreement between the PHQ diag-
noses and the MHP diagnoses was examined.
Analysis
For analyses assessing the operating character-
istics of various PHQ-2 cutpoints, diagnostic sta-
tus (major depressive disorder, other depressive
disorder, or no depressive disorder) was that as-
signed by the independent MHP structured psy-
chiatric interview. The latter is considered the
criterion standard and provides the most conser-
vative estimate of the operating characteristics of
the PHQ-2 score. Besides calculating sensitivity
and specificity of the PHQ-2 over various inter-
vals, we also determined likelihood ratios15 and
conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis16 as quantitative methods for com-
bining sensitivity and specificity into a single
metric.
Construct validity of the PHQ-2 as a measure of
depression severity was assessed by examining func-
tional status (the 6 SF-20 scales), disability days,
symptom-related difficulty, and healthcare utiliza-
tion (clinic visits) over the various PHQ-2 scores.
Analysis of covariance was used with PHQ-2 score
as the independent variable and adjusting for age,
sex, race, education, study site, and number of phys-
ical disorders. Bonferroni’s correction was used to
adjust for multiple comparisons.
Decrements in SF-20 scores were also exam-
ined in terms of effect size, which is the difference
in mean SF-20 scores, expressed as the number of
standard deviations, between each PHQ-2 score
and the reference group. The reference group was
subjects with a PHQ-2 score of 0, and the standard
deviation used was that of the entire sample.
Results
Distribution of PHQ-2 Scores According to
Depression Diagnostic Status
Table 1 shows the distribution of PHQ-2 scores
according to depression diagnostic status in the
580 patients interviewed by an MHP who was
blinded to the PHQ-2 results. Of the 41 subjects
who had major depressive disorder, 93% endorsed
at least some depressed mood (1 or greater) and
95% endorsed at least some anhedonia. The ma-
jority of patients (95%) with no depressive disor-
der had a PHQ-2 score less than 3, whereas most
patients (83%) with major depression had scores
of 3 or greater. Patients with other (ie, nonmajor)
depressive disorder exhibited more heterogeneity
in their PHQ-2 scores.

†Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value refers to a threshold PHQ-2 score (ie, all subjects with that
score or higher), whereas likelihood ratio refers to a discrete PHQ-2 score (ie, only subjects with that specific score).
For example, 82.9% of patients with major depressive disorder have a PHQ-2 score of 3 or greater (sensitivity),
90% of patients without major depressive disorder have a score of less than 3 (specificity), 38.4% of patients with a
score of 3 or greater have major depressive disorder (positive predictive value), and a score of 3 is 2.9 times more
likely in patients with than without major depressive disorder (likelihood ratio).

cutpoint of 5. The positive predictive value for any
depressive disorder (which had a prevalence of
18%) ranged from 48% for a PHQ-2 cutpoint of 2
to 85% for a cutpoint of 5. At a cutpoint of 3 or
higher, the PHQ-2 had a likelihood ratio for major
depression of 2.92, nearly identical to the overall
likelihood ratio of 2.86 reported for 9 other depres-
sion case finding instruments in a meta-analysis of
the literature.2 Regarding concordance with the
MHP interview, a PHQ-2 cutpoint of 3 or greater
was comparable to the PHQ-9 diagnostic algo-
rithm for any depressive disorder (kappa of 0.62
vs. 0.58) as well as major depressive disorder
(kappa of 0.48 vs. 0.54).
ROC analysis showed that the area under the
curve (AUC) for the PHQ-2 in diagnosing major
depressive disorder was 0.93 (vs. 0.95 for the
longer PHQ-9). The AUC of the PHQ-2 for diag-
nosing any depressive disorder was 0.90 (vs. 0.92
for the PHQ-9). Although the AUC for both major
and any depressive disorder was similar for
women and men, age had a modest effect. The
AUC for major depressive disorder was somewhat
greater in subjects less than 60 years compared
with those 60 years and older (0.94 vs. 0.86),
whereas for any depressive disorder, younger sub-
jects had a lower AUC (0.88 vs. 0.95).
Construct Validity of the PHQ-2 Assessed
by Functional Status and Other Measures
As shown in Table 3, there was a strong asso-
ciation between increasing PHQ-2 depression se-
verity scores and worsening function on all 6
SF-20 scales. Several findings should be noted.
First, results were essentially the same for both the
primary care and obstetrics–gynecology samples.
Second, the monotonic decrease in SF-20 scores
with increasing PHQ-2 scores were greatest for
the scales that previous studies have shown
should be most strongly related to depression, ie,
mental health, followed by social, overall, and role
functioning, with a lesser relationship to pain and
physical functioning.14 Third, most pairwise com-
parisons within each SF-20 scale between succes-
sive PHQ-2 levels were highly significant.
Figure 1 illustrates graphically the relationship
between increasing PHQ-2 scores and worsening
functional status. Decrements in SF-20 scores are
shown in terms of effect size. Effect sizes of 0.5 and
0.8 are typically considered moderate and large
between-group differences, respectively.17 Figure 1
shows effect sizes for the primary care sample;
results for the obstetrics–gynecology sample (not
displayed) were similar.
When the PHQ-2 was examined as a continu-
ous variable, its strength of association with the
SF-20 scales was concordant with the pattern seen
in Figure 1. In both the primary care and obstet-
rics–gynecology samples, the PHQ-2 correlated
most strongly with mental health (0.70 and 0.63),
followed by general health perceptions (0.47 and
0.46), social functioning (0.46 and 0.36), physical
functioning (0.37 and 0.36), role functioning (0.37
and 0.29), and bodily pain (0.26 and 0.31).
Table 4 shows the association between PHQ-2
severity levels and 3 other measures of construct
validity: self-reported disability days, clinic visits,
and the general amount of difficulty patients at-
tribute to their symptoms. Greater levels of de-
pression severity were associated with a mono-
tonic
increase
in
disability
days,
healthcare
utilization, and symptom-related difficulty in ac-
tivities and relationships.
Discussion
Our study provides strong evidence for the
validity of the PHQ-2 as a brief depression screen-
ing measure. Criterion validity was demonstrated
by the fact that the operating characteristics of the
PHQ-2 compared favorably with an independent
MHP interview in a sample of 585 patients. Con-
struct validity was established by the strong asso-
ciation between PHQ-2 scores and functional
status, disability days, and symptom-related diffi-
culty. The sample of 6000 patients from 15 geo-
graphically dispersed clinics as well as the similar-
ity of findings in 2 different patient populations
(primary care and obstetrics–gynecology) en-
hances the generalizability of our findings.
The PHQ-9 would still be the preferred instru-
ment when the intent is either to definitively
diagnose depressive disorders or to assess depres-
sion outcomes in response to treatment. This is
because the PHQ-9 includes all 9 symptom crite-
ria necessary for establishing DSM-IV depressive
disorder diagnoses and provides a wider range of
depressive symptom severity scores (0–27) com-
pared with the PHQ-2 (0–6). However, in many
settings, the purpose is not to establish final
diagnoses or to monitor depression severity, but
rather to screen for depression in a “first step”
approach. Even briefer versions might be desirable

when the aim is to include just a few depression
questions in multipurpose health questionnaires.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently
recommended depression screening as part of
routine care.1 However, brevity is essential to
accomplish this in the busy general medical set-
ting where patient volume is high, most visits are
brief, and depression is simply one of many con-
ditions that the primary care clinician is responsi-
ble for recognizing and managing.6–8
Others have shown that 1 or 2 questions about
depressed mood and, possibly, anhedonia are
quite sensitive as a first-stage depression screen-
ing procedure.2–4,9,18 Whereas Whooley and col-
leagues also found that the 2 depression items of
the original PRIME-MD performed similarly to

longer case-finding instruments,3 our findings
build on this earlier work for 4 important reasons.
First, our PHQ studies included 6000 patients from
multiple clinics representing a more diverse pop-
ulation, whereas Whooley et al. studied 536 pa-
tients who were mostly male (97%) veterans
drawn from a single clinic. Second, the original
PRIME-MD evaluated by Whooley et al. was de-
signed as a 2-stage procedure in which positive
responses on the patient questionnaire prompted
a structured interview using a clinician evaluation
guide. To maximize sensitivity, the timeframe for
depressed mood and anhedonia was the past
month and the response options were simply yes
or no. Because the PHQ was intended to be
exclusively a patient self-report version of the
PRIME-MD,
2
important
modifications
were
made: the timeframe focused on the past 2 weeks
and the response options were expanded to 4 to
better delineate the number of days patients were
bothered by depressed mood and/or anhedonia.
This makes the one-stage PHQ more consistent
with DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders and
therefore greatly improves the specificity of the
PHQ-2
compared
with
the
2
items
of
the
PRIME-MD with only a modest decline in sensi-
tivity. Specificity is an important consideration if
depression screening becomes more widespread,
because a large number of false-positives would
be difficult to handle efficiently in the context of
the large patient volume, short visits, and compet-
ing demands of primary care.6–8 Third, the char-
acteristic of better discriminating between de-
pressed and nondepressed patients is exemplified
by the PHQ-2’s higher AUC for major depression
of 0.93 compared with 0.82 for the 2-item
PRIME-MD as reported by Whooley et al. Because
this comparison is drawn from 2 different studies
(albeit both primary care), a head-to-head com-
parison of the operating characteristics of the
PHQ-2 versus the 2-item PRIME-MD would op-
timally be performed in the same patient popula-
tion. Fourth, the PHQ is rapidly replacing the
original PRIME-MD in both research and clinical
settings, so understanding the operating charac-
teristics of the PHQ-2 as a depression screener is
important for pragmatic reasons.
The operating characteristics of the PHQ-2
displayed at various cutpoints in Table 2 compare
favorably to 9 other case-finding instruments for
depression in primary care that have an overall
sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 72%, and a
positive likelihood ratio of 2.86.2 At a cutpoint of 3,
the PHQ-2 has a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of
90%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.9. Like-
wise, the positive predictive value of the PHQ-2

things at home, or get along with other people?” The 4 response categories are “not difficult at all,” “somewhat
difficult,” “very difficult,” and “extremely difficult.” Symptom-related difficulty in this table refers to those patients
reporting “very” or “extremely” difficult.

for major depression in our sample in which the
prevalence of major depression was 7% (similar to
other outpatient samples) ranged from 20% to
45% as the cutpoint was varied from 2 to 5. This
predictive value is similar to other instruments. Of
note, predictive value is related not only to a
measure’s sensitivity and specificity, but also to the
prevalence of depressive disorders.
The one depression measure that was used
concurrently with the PHQ-2 in our subjects was
the 5-item mental health scale of the SF-20, also
known as the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5).
PHQ-2 scores were strongly correlated with
MHI-5 scores in both the primary care (r  .70)
and obstetrics–gynecology (r  .63) samples, an
association clearly illustrated in Table 3 and Figure
1. Berwick and colleagues used ROC analysis to
determine how well the MHI-5 and several other
measures discriminated between patients with
and without major depression.19 In their study, the
AUC was 0.89 for the MHI-5, 0.90 for the longer
MHI-18, 0.89 for the 30-item General Health
Questionnaire, and 0.80 for the 28-item Somatic
Symptom Inventory. In our study, the AUC for
major depression was 0.95 for the PHQ-9 and 0.93
for both the PHQ-2 and the MHI-5. Because an
AUC of 1.0 signifies a perfect test, it is unlikely that
other
depression
measures
are
diagnostically
superior.
Several caveats should be mentioned. First,
screening with the PHQ-2 is only a first step.
Patients who screen positive should be further
evaluated with the PHQ-9, other diagnostic in-
struments,
or
direct
interview
to
determine
whether they meet criteria for a depressive disor-
der. High scores on the PHQ-2 alone would
typically not be a sufficient basis to initiate treat-
ment without diagnostic confirmation. Second,
subjects in our study completed the PHQ-2 as part
of the PHQ-9. An alternative design would be to
administer the PHQ-2 to one group of subjects
and the PHQ-9 to a second comparable group;
establishing similar operating characteristics with
this method would further validate the PHQ-2 as
a stand-alone depression screener. Third, picking
the optimal PHQ-2 cutpoint, like with any mea-
sure, is a trade-off between sensitivity and speci-
ficity. Although our analysis suggests a cutpoint of 3
provides a reasonable compromise, a cutpoint of
2 would enhance sensitivity, whereas a cutpoint
of 4 would improve specificity. One must be
cautious about overemphasizing sensitivity with
depression screening in primary care, partly be-
cause of the high volume of patients in primary
care and partly because a very sensitive cutpoint
coupled with a 5% to 10% prevalence of major
depression means that most patients screening
positive are false-positive cases.2 In settings in
which the prevalence of depression is much higher
(eg, psychiatric settings or hospitalized patients), a
different cutpoint might be considered.
A third caveat is that depression screening by
itself is not enough.20,21 Adequate follow up, de-
pression severity monitoring, and access when
needed to MHPs are required to detect medication
noncompliance, increase the antidepressant dos-
age, change or augment pharmacotherapy, or add
psychotherapy as needed.22–24 Even the U.S. Pre-
ventive Services Task Force concludes that depres-
sion screening is only effective if coupled with
systems changes to appropriately diagnose and
treat depression.1 In this sense, depression is no
different than many other medical disorders such
as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, in which
detection must be combined with initial patient
education and activation and ongoing disease
monitoring and management, with a partnership
forged between the patient, the primary care pro-
vider, and the specialist.
Asking about depressed mood and anhedonia
would typically not require a paper questionnaire,
unless the items are included as part of a longer
health survey. Most clinicians could easily remem-
ber these 2 core symptoms. The PHQ-2 response
options simply allow patients to grade the amount
of time they have been bothered by either symp-
tom in the past 2 weeks, a core feature of the
DSM-IV criteria and one that distinguishes fleet-
ing from more persistent mood symptoms. Being
bothered by either depressed mood or anhedonia
“nearly everyday” or one symptom “more than
half the days” and the other symptom “several
days” would result in a PHQ-2 score of 3. This
score (or a lower score if other “red flags” of
depression are present8) could trigger administra-
tion of the full PHQ-9.
Brevity is a particularly attractive feature of
measures intended for use in clinical practice. In
the words of Mies van de Rohe, the modern
architect, “less is more.” For example, one reason
for the popularity of the 4-item CAGE question-
naire (a questionnaire for alcoholism evaluation)25
could be its brevity compared with longer alcohol
screening measures. Likewise, simplifying depres-
sion screening to 2 questions enhances routine
